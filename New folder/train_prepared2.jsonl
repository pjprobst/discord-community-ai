If you know JavaScript and html good enough react isn’t too bad to learn on your own tbh. But if you don’t know either I’d take 1520 (or learn them first on your own) Or typescript if you don’t hate yourself We covered React when I took it with Farnan 2 years ago Not sure if anything has changed since ok not surprising wow Paulo was BAD. Like we just did basic vanilla javascript and html the whole time Yeah it was HTML -> CSS -> JS -> Python -> React -> Rust/Wasm with farnan; and some miscellaneous stuff sprinkled between It wasn't covered when I took it last year, but that was because Farnan was sick a bunch and ended up being behind on content Rust will be taught no matter what though lol Hey, I wanted to learn web dev and Paulo delivered Web dev circa 2003… I’m not a humongous Paulo fan lol Has web dev really changed that much since then? I mean the fundamentals are still the same. That’s like complaining 1501 isn’t taught in C++ yes and by what metric is c++ considered more modern than java? In what ways? More work on the programmer. Misurda complained that Pitt cs students aren’t qualified cuz the schools keeps making classes easier. C++ -> Java was one of his objections. so he's saying c++ is more work that java? why does that make it more modern? if you get hired for webdev you are expected to be able to use react/ whatever webframework and be familar with build tools. from the sounds of it, the class doesn't teach that. i personally enjoy building websites from scratch, but I'm under no illusion that it is a useful skill for employers. it's not. me when I say use the class keyword in js instead of doing a `const name = () => {...}; ` lol i mean that's 21 years lol i'm trying not to be mean there's just like. there's *so much* different now also like even the *fundamentals* are different and more complex way way way different even like http is different as someone that lived through it... it's impossible to describe the differences"}

I put 3 on my resume and recruiters would bring it up for time to time. Sort of relevant to full stacky web stuff So I work for cloudflare doing low-ish level network programming and distributed systems stuff (i wrote up a giant post about the stuff I use last night! It's here: https://discord.com/channels/729022532874797146/746122628896522270/1370655038808129556 !) and I have led coding and system design interviews. I haven't done resume scanning, since I'm not an engineering manager, but my advice in general is you're going for a systems-y job would be to use 3, for the following reasons: - familiarity with network programming (e.g. sockets, packets, etc) is absolutely the most important skill set necessary for my team, since we literally write and maintain a user-space packet router. Network programming concepts are also incredibly important in almost every other team that I interact with through my work as well, and I would imagine that the same is true for almost all of the other teams at Cloudflare as well (since we're literally a cdn and edge computing company that handles like 20% of all traffic on the Internet lol) - concurrent programming is also super important for my team especially. Our services are written in rust using async/await styling sitting in front of multiple threads, and there are plenty of circumstances where knowing when to use concurrency structures (mutex, rwlock, etc), which ones to use (and why!) and trying to find a way to find ways to *avoid* using them to do the task is absolutely necessary - those two things combined into a single project is even better, because it shows that you're able to understand and use those concepts in a more realistic scenario For why not to use the other ones: - I don't know what the graphics library does but it's not relevant to a lot of the work going on now, at least in generic industry jobs that tend to be web programming in some scope (frontend, backend or full stack), and it's certainly not relevant to my team and the teams we interact with - implementing a syscall is cool and instructive but definitely not a full project (In resume terms at least). Knowing how system calls work (interrupts, etc); what context switching is, a general idea of how it's done, and an idea of why we want to minimize the need to do it as much as possible; and what user-space and kernel-space are, how they're different, and the advantages and usage of them compared to each other are all very important in systems work, but knowing how to implement a syscall yourself isn't really that big of a part of any of this - nobody is hand-rolling concurrency primitives lol. Using them and stuff is important, but yeah - idk what the scope of this is but I would also say that knowing what skills you've learned from it is good, but the project itself isn't super relevant to a lot of companies Second what @Maddie Pratt said. I can say for certain that I brought up project 5: virtual memory simulator up during an interview for the company I work for, but that’s bc we are actually developing kernel code. So pretty much unless you are applying for jobs like that, project 3 is the most generally applicable"}

I haven't taken any AI/ML courses yet and I know some people have said to do that before taking 1684. So, does it sound manageable? Is there anything I should be wary of for this arrangement?

I think this helps students who have trouble time managing. lol what This is what i was told, correct me if i'm wrong"}
{"text": "449 Profs I know a similar question was posted but I wanted to get more insight based on my specific context. I took Jarrett for 447 and in contrast to what most people say about him/have experienced with him, I didn't like his teaching. He was too handholdy and aggressive with a few students and his whole \"this stuff is so easy!!\" did not bode well for me (I need someone to tell me that x is hard to understand but here's how it works). I definitely don't want to take Midurda as I've heard too many terrible things about him but the reason I'm hesitating to commit to having Luis as my prof is because I've heard the projects are very difficult. I have Farnan for 1501 currently and the projects are rough so far and I want to avoid being in a similar boat next semester. I also want to learn as much as I can. I'd love it if someone could give insight on Jarrett vs Luis. And for Luis's projects how many hours per week did you have to spend and any other information you think could be useful. For context: I'd be taking a higher-level elective (likely 1632), linear algebra, a poetry class, a phil gen ed, and perhaps drugs and behavior along with 449. oh wow was not expecting this much discourse but thank you all for the insight! for luis, how many hours outside of class did those who took him for 449 spend for his projects and all? and like compared to farnan's projects, what would the difficulty level be (like 80% as hard as farnan's projects, etc.)?", "answers": "If you want someone with the teaching style of “x is hard to understand but here’s how it works” I actually think Misurda ( I have him for 1550) is the most fitting out of the options you’re considering, Luis would be second (I had him for 449) and Jarrett would be third (I’m his current 449 ta and had him for other classes) People hate misurda cuz he doesn’t let u pass unless u do the work, he’s one of the best profs I’ve had at Pitt. Ppl are just lazy. When else are u going to sit down to grind the systems fundamentals if not in college? Better yet with misurda cuz he is rigorous Luis is great too But u are gonna be taking a lot of courses concurrently idk if that schedule is even a good idea I think Misurda is the best lecturer but there’s a few times where he hasn’t prepared students for the projects and assignments second all this - misurda took me a while to get used to but he's an excellent lecturer and really really understands it. olivera's 449 didn't have that hard projects tho (like at least not surprisingly). I'm aware this isn't shared but farnan's 1501 projects were the hardest programming projects relative to my skill level I had in my entire undergrad also drugs and behavior sucks imo take albanna's brain and behavior and intro to ethics with Theunissen I would say misurda's projects can be a little more difficult bc of his expectations of students skill level. But also he is always behind and he still releases projects even though he hasn't taught the relevant information regarding the assignment. All in all, i would recommend taking 449 for Luis, but with Misurda, it's still doable. The projects in 449 are all standardized across the board regardless of the professor though So if we’re only talking about lecture style Misurda explains the concepts as is without sugar coating it and I think that’s what they’re looking for Not really, his 449 x86 project was given a week before he taught x86 But yeah, his lecturing style is impeccable And in reality, it's still doable, but I have a pet peeve with teachers assigning assignments that they haven't taught all the relevant information. I meant material wise but that doesn’t sound too great lol ahh okay mb lmao but yeah like i am glad i had him for 1550 like if you want a challenge and too really understand the material: misurda is your guy this entire convo is making me want to go retake 449 with misurda i had luis and thought the material was very easy considering I had just taken 447, but I wonder if misurda would have changed that 1550 is like a demonstrably different set of concepts tho - id still only take misurda for that i wish we could retake some of them tho - i'd totally speedrun lol you could just audit the class for fun and then like steal the project details from the students i think it depends. some people pick up C really quickly, others (like myself) need the entire semester to fully understand the language. bc of this, i had to give more time than i wanted for the projects. looking back, i would compare the projects 70%/80% difficulty compared to the farnan projects I remembered one time I emailed misurda about a question in the project after searching on google for like an hour. And he responded me that “Stop using Google as ur not asking the right questions” That really broke my heart I spammed like thousands of emails last semester to finish those projects, and he won’t give a single hint which is insane But he is good lecturer after all, the projects were challenging and they were really fun. I would recommend to take his class if ur a good self-learner as someone who had farnan for 1501 and luis for 449 last semester i spent at least 2x more time working on farnans projects then i did for luis’s Echo the c thing tho from @Derrick Hicks I knew it before and so I don’t think I ever spent more than like 10 hours total on a project Wait actually except the first reverse engineer one that was hard Unless you are a maniac and love assembly in which case I’m both scared and impressed by you homie said your maniacs and love assembly, but also wanted 1501 in asm lmao"}

Does this seem normal/doable? I know this is subjective and depends on the electives I choose, but if it helps, the ones that interest me are 1555, 1530 or 1631/1632, 1645, 1652, 1671, 1674 thank you! thanks so much!

And does 1530 overlap with either of them at all? I’m having trouble understanding the differences between them Damn i gotta stop looking at pitt cs wiki i guess got it thanks for the help", "answers": "I did this but 1501 instead of 1503 and different electives and it really wasn't too bad. I'd recommend Sem 1: 449, 1503, 2 electives Sem 2: 1550, 2 electives Sem 3: 2 electives, capstone, gen eds Pair the easier required courses (449, 1503) at the beginning. Then semester 1 and 2 will be a similar difficulty. This way semester 3 will be a nice easy way to finish college, the internship capstone is literally the easiest class ever (just an essay and a presentation the whole semester). You could throw the gen eds in wherever honestly. It's totally doable and I don't think too abnormal for most people I took 1555 and 1632 the same semester and both are pretty easy. Otherwise I didn’t take the other electives I’m in 1671 rn also. 1555, 1632, and 1671 all have pretty major group projects, and I’m pretty sure 1530 does also so maybe consider that as well for when you want to take them. Some of these aren’t offered every semester so that would need to be considered also I’m not a huge fan but I think it’s mostly because I’m not really interested in machine learning or linguistics…not really sure why I took the class tbh…but I think you’ll enjoy it if you find those topics interesting. The group project is very free range so you can explore any topic you find interesting definitely doable. ben's suggestion here is solid: https://discord.com/channels/729022532874797146/1349144384297238620/1349155642778189924 the only thing is that 449 is a prereq for 1632, 1645, and 1652 so those won't be options for sem 1 since 1671 and 1674 are ML classes i'd also rec leaving them until after 1503 (you'll probably have to anyway) which leaves you with 1555 and 1530 for sem 1 (def doable, assuming class times don't conflict) 1550 is on the harder side so for sem 2 i'd lean 1632 + 1671 (both easier) and then in sem 3 you can take whatever's left of 1645, 1652, and 1674 1631 is nonexistent @Lena Carson 1632 is about writing *tests* for software. dunno what's taught in 1530 anymore but it's supposed to be about writing software *itself* 1632 & 1555 are def good classes to take if you want to do swe stuff. 1632 is all testing, mostly unit testing but you get into some other stuff as well. 1555 is first half SQL but there is also some theoretical stuff about relational databases.

Not incidental but not the main thrust of the class It's mostly lectures and projects Like there's more paper discussions in this version I guess but they're not like... Abstract papers And learning how to read and analyze and understand academic papers is actually pretty important imo Seminars (3xxx level classes) tend to be entirely reading papers and doing presentations on them and maybe a project at the end Even if you *don't* have an interest in a PhD, knowing how to read papers is good the higher level you get in industry The more novel stuff you do the more likely it'll matter Like, upper level senior/staff/(especially) principal Lol... I mean I think that's a terrible reason especially when you only get the chance to do it guided once ... Why? If you don't like reading or interacting with research papers... Tbf, Babay may teach it differently. I think longfei in general has a strong emphasis on modern research and reading papers and staying up to date. We had a project, paper presentation and then every other week ish we had a paper review which is like a couple paragraphs of writing. I am not interested in wide area networks and I still enjoyed the papers and topics."}

TAship will prob look good on your resume no matter your career path, but it'll look especially good if you're applying to grad school you can def get into grad school with a mid gpa (getting into a *top-ranked* grad school is a diff matter), so imo the bigger question is whether you *need* grad school for your career goals imo if you're not considering grad school or any career path where teaching skills specifically will be desirable, TAing might only be worth it if you genuinely *want* to i.e., you either like teaching or you wanna work with a specific prof or you're really passionate about the material for a specific class oh yeah, getting letters of rec is also a big perk of TAing cuz you're closely working with a prof and literally teaching their classes again, grad school and research-related positions e.g., if you're applying to a summer research job with REU or with a university's summer research program, you'll likely need LoRs the number of hours you work can vary *wildly* depending on what prof you TA for and which class you TA for however, if you're planning on keeping your current job as well, you might only be able to take on 1 TA position, in which case you'd be capped at 10 hrs for a single TA position, i think the absolute bare minimum would be 4 hrs: 3 hrs minimum of OH plus 1 hr for recitation/lab not necessarily \"bigger number harder\", cuz for example 449 is prob harder to TA than 1501, based on what i've heard from other TAs and TAing 447 may be easier than TAing 445, but i'm less confident about that 1502 doesn't have recitations, so it's not available as an option anyway trust me: if it had been available as a TA position, i would've done it those are grad students i think the distrust of undergrads is mainly due to potential conflicts of interest whereas distrust of grads can't be due to anything other than sheer incompetence profs for other classes typically don't let undergrads grade either that being said, *if* 1502 had been available to UTAs, it def would've been much easier than TAing 449 so back to the previous point: bigger number doesn't always mean harder to TA i think a better predictor is required programming (or more broadly technical) skill", "answers": "Can someone do a ta difficulty tier list?

If you want easy money you can TA the intro classes. 0007 and 0010/11/12. You basically do nothing. idk bro, 0007 kids need a lot of help bc a lot of them aren't actually CS majors and are just taking 0007 as a side req for what they *are* studying. 8/10 of my peer tutoring appointments this past spring were 0007 students and it was *painful* can't speak to the python intro courses though When I did it I never got anyone in office hours. Same for 0010/11/12. Did it for a year and half and maybe got 4 people total. a mid gpa isn't necessarily a disqualifier for grad school, if you're interested in doing research i think being a research standout is more important. e.g. my dad is a prof at cmu and told me that one of his all-time best phd students and researchers (who is now also a full-time prof at cmu) only had a 3.2 undergrad gpa he did research with my dad as an undergrad so my dad knew his potential as a researcher, which is why he accepted him as a phd student even if you're not interested in a phd/doing research, there are industry-oriented master's programs (including pitt's, which can be customized to include either a research or practical capstone) that you could probably still get into also, if you don't *want* to be a UTA, then *don't* lol you'll not only be hurting yourself, but also the students trying to learn from you primary motivation for being a UTA should be wanting to help students, the money should be secondary (esp. because, as mentioned above, you can make more money in other positions) the pay for all positions at pitt, besides board of directors and football program, is low second this I found 401 and 445 tutoring easier than 0007"}
{"text": "Are there any restrictions in taking graduate courses in undergrad? I was thinking about taking some graduate level courses in undergrad within the CS department and wanted to know if they could be used to fulfil requirements or could only be taken in certain terms etc.", "answers": "you have to get permission from the professor of the course and your academic advisor then submit a permission request here https://courses.sci.pitt.edu/login then you’ll get a permission number you can put in also would you mind changing your display name to your real name i think there's some restriction like you can only count 1 graduate-level course at pitt towards your undergrad requirements also if you plan on doing an MS in CS at pitt, you can count up to two 16xx courses that you took as an undergrad towards the MS or wait, this might be for counting a graduate-level course that you took as an undergrad towards master's requirements. ask your advisor make sure to not write your year in your email bc profs can be spiky in admitting say sophomores into grad classes (depends on the prof tho) Hot take you should not be trying to take a graduate level class if you are a sophomore lol I don’t see why not. If you’ve reached the end of the sequence of classes in a topic/area you should take the grad course. With few exceptions I didn’t find them that much more difficult than the harder upper level electives. The raw difficulty of the work isn't necessarily why; the difference between 2100+ graduate courses and undergrad classes and the 20xx graduate level ones (which are typically cross-listed with undergrad classes) is not only the depth and complexity of the actual material. The more relevant differences between undergrad and graduate courses is the *way* they're taught and how you're expected to engage with the material. Specifically, in a grad level class, you're expected to be able to learn and get a solid understanding of a lot of material that is *not* presented in lectures or in slides or whatever. This is just flat out not something that sophomores are taught or prepared to do at that point in their degree, and honestly upper level undergraduate electives don't expect this to nearly the same extent in most cases. Also, *just* needing to learn material from outside of lecture isn't really the only difference; you're also expected to be able to apply material from lectures and from outside of lectures in ways that you aren't explicitly taught how to do in lecture. Another huge leap in complexity from undergrad to grad level classes is the level of detail and helper code that you're given for your projects; in undergrad classes, especially the ones you'll have taken up to your sophomore year (which is like... The core 04xx level prerequisites, maybe 1501/1502/1503? I guess possibly 1550 or maybe one upper level elective in rarer cases?), you're given generally very detailed project descriptions, and oftentimes you're also given a lot of the \"side\" code/utilities/etc and, maybe more importantly, tests (note that grade scope counts as being given tests even if you can't see what they are doing in code). And like, I've genuinely seen a lot of undergrads, especially freshmen and sophomores, complain about the projects they're assigned using material that they haven't been taught, or that the descriptions are necessarily clear enough, and that they don't know what the tests are doing. In contrast, assignments in graduate level courses are *very* loosely specified. they're typically around one page. You're also usually given only a very high level description of the project, and in many cases you're not even given any information on specific functions that you need to implement or a specific external API that you need to adhere to. Graduate projects also do not usually adhere to the \"all of the stuff you'll need to know to do this will have been taught in lecture or in prior courses in the sequence\" thing that undergrad assignments do. I mentioned this above, but it was worth repeating anyway. One of the other major differences is along the lines of the first point; the amount of prewritten code that you're given is dramatically less, and the way they're evaluated is also very different. Like, most of my graduate classes did not give *any* code with the projects whatsoever. You're literally almost always expected to write the entire codebase starting from an empty folder. You're also expected to write your own tests and in general ensure that your code functions as intended on your own, again with no specific test implementations given, and usually you're not even given what specific tests that you need to try to run to ensure correctness. You are literally expected to be able to design, implement, and test an entire project from scratch from a one-ish page specification. Also like, auto graders are almost never used, which fits in nicely with the \"no tests are given\" thing. You'll get no external feedback about whether or not your code is working (like sometimes talking to the TA can help, but nothing is given by default). Grad projects, from experience as a TA, are usually graded *by hand* by the ta. This is both good and bad! There are more opportunities for partial credit! But there are also more opportunities to miss incorrect behavior due to not knowing how we'll test it So all of that is to say, even if the provided material and the subject matter isn't explicitly harder, the expectations that you are under *are*. Also! A lot of graduate level classes don't give exams at all, and most of the grade is in the projects that you're assigned. This is also good and bad! Tests aren't super useful for gauging understanding anyway in my opinion. The shift to only projects, though, makes time management skills so much more important I just had a different experience then ig. Of the 12 grad courses i've taken; 10 had exams, 6 had only one exam, 2 had no exams. Course projects were guard railed more or less the same as upper level electives. Maybe more open ended but really nothing special considering the time frame given which could be multiple weeks. People should take all opportunities available to them to take courses that interest them. 🤷 My year didnt make a difference for my experience, took grad courses all my undergrad into my masters. I took two graduate classes when I was a sophomore! One in the law school and one in the cs department. Just email the professors and if you are passionate they will find a way. Makes for a lot more of an academically enriching semester to take classes you are taking out of the passion of taking them, not just because you have to"}

But I'm also told that I'm not a good judge of these things. Big flex Might just be Grad OS, I thought they had a separate class for it GradOS is 2510 Yea grad OS = distributed systems So it's 2510 Grad os is the best bc it’s the most relevant you can take up to 3 grad courses as ug Think programs that run on multiple machines simultaneously E.g., Server-client, P2P, stuff like that E,g., Discord has software that runs on multiple clients and a server Basically think of programs that communicate from different nodes (servers) to achieve some goal. This could be a groupchat that keeps a consistent view of the chat for example. You need a permission number which entails permission from the instructor https://courses.sci.pitt.edu/permission I hate grad OS but not bc its a bad class just bc why the fuck don't we have a real OS course or why doesn't the dept admit defeat and change the damn name this actually makes me want to take an OS class tho chris it's not an OS class in any sense there are 0 OS concepts in the entire semester it is purely networking and consensus algorithms ya if you're into it its a good course babay is a good prof and very nice but I got hardcore bait and switched and I'm still annoyed Lee is good too! Tho he's not teaching it in the spring Lee actually relates it really well to 1550 ya if any of you end up in 2510 in the spring I'll catch you there I got a C because babay refused to give our group credit for the first project bc we didn't have a dockefile and my final project was mid Amen, I want a class where I build an OS you could always cross-enroll with CMU Depends on who you take, for Dr Lee you learn more about virtualization and scheduling.

Dr Lee is epic counting this as a dub sent you a DM about this but for posterity's sake, i've heard that 1666 does a decent job of emulating real-world SWE i'd also probably take at least one of 1675 and/or 1678 based on how the industry is trending and what your abovementioned choice of electives seems to say about your interests within CS i would be super surprised if it got taught as anything other than distributed systems i maintain that that is a fucking stupid decision distributed systems are, in all honesty, much more important to learn than the internals of operating systems in general imo then call it distributed systems so i can stay far far away from it that being said, i do think there would be value in teaching an actual grad level OS class you also have a phd in the subject i feel like you are not the most unbiased opinion on the matter i don't have my phd yet but that is true! i am, however, working for a CDN company the stuff i push to main gets deployed globally and it's a cool thought lol 1635 would also be a good choice from what i've heard, but if you've already taken 1520 some of it might be redundant 1530 CS 1666 involves project management, sprints, and teamwork"}

When writing your bullet points next summer, your accomplishments will be much more appealing to recruiters because of all the amazing work you did. Also, congrats on the two offers—that’s huge!

{"text": "C++ at Pitt Hi all, I'm taking 449 and I love C. There's a lot of real time audio work I want to work with that is too slow in JavaScript. Is there a c++ heavy course elective at Pitt ? Or a continuation of C like languages? Is C++ in good demand for engineers still ? I've thought about looking into rust too, seems to be on the rise. Thank you!!! Awesome!! I've checked out librosa with python, theres an emerging community with python audio feature extracting and machine learning too. I don't wanna be a library goblin though, and if I could make my own better library i will. Definitely gonna check out rust's way of signal processing. oh wow im really trying to sneak into fourier transform Is there a way to email ECE professors about that? I guess you would need the prereqs and they would just have to confirm someone from an outer school? i think the one i was looking at was Digital signal processing Yeaaa a lot of it looks like heavy circuitry prereqs I don't have calc 3 sadly. Do classes like that have big lectures? As in showing up for a lecture or two that i see from a schedule without being kicked out ... computer engineering minor thoughts???? I see some summer classes for EE I gave up on impressing the employer really. I was more curious if its a worthy program to gain worthy knowledge in signal processing in software. thank u both so much for your insights. Might be one of those things I just read books on, but pitt always has surprising resources in their programs so I figured I'd ask . I really do not wanna take chem lmao. im taking my double major out of dietrich because everything has been a nightmare between advisors , i hate this multi school system fortran I know, I am about to back out. because 9 extra dietrich gen eds :< Thank you so much.", "answers": "iirc 1666 game design used to be taught in c++ but is now taught in rust. that reflects a broader shift from c/c++ to rust in industry systems programming though, so it's not necessarily a bad thing non-core classes that are taught in C (not C++) include wonsun's 1622 compilers, 1541 computer architecture, 1652 computer networks, and i think 1651 advanced systems software yeah rust is in demand for systems programmers these days bc it has C-level performance while being memory-safe Rust has a well established real-time audio community https://discord.gg/cNDBcE5r Depending on what you're trying to do, python isn't always that bad bc lots of the libraries bind to c I've done a bunch of audio work in the past & I'm working on something audio related rn so feel free to reach out just a note that 1651 (at least last semester) is not taught in any programming languages rly? there are no programming assignments? try sneaking into ECE computer engineering classes, those r primarily c++ fourier transform? Do u mean the signal processing classes? that class is a sequel to signals and systems signals and systems can be got into with i think a lin alg and maybe calc 3, youd probably have to email they r very math based classes with a little matlab in them taught usually by either Murat Akcakaya, Steven Jacobs, or Robert Kerestes they r considered more EE classes than CE i think if you have proper math background its doable, the circuitry part isnt that important also if you ever have questions about wanting to take an ECE course generally, emailing Dr. Dickerson is the best choice for questions, one of the best advisors at Pitt its about 50 people classes usually, generally most people in ece know eachother tho due to being limited and everyone having basically the same classes sophomore year, but you could still probably sneak in and pretend you're one of the people who never shows up to class i doubt theyd care if you sat in Calc 3 isn't required at all for computer engineering for some reason coe is a very cursed major idk ece has a class called 401 (has a name idk), which is a mix of lin alg, some calc 3 stuff, and basically a pre signals and systems If you are interested, go for it. In the grand scheme of things no one will really care about what minor you have, just do something that you are interested in and that you will enjoy. Could also open a few extra opportunities here and ther ik it can be bypassed but i forget the exact courses needed to bypass Yes but you calc 3 isn't a prereq for any of the classes. Probably covers a good amount of calc 3 content though ik, but idk if by avoiding 401 youd need to take calc 3 or not to take dsp cause DSP is considered an EE class its still probably worth taking calc 3 imo either way, but just ask Dickerson signals and systems is 90% math and theory, dsp is a bit more practical, there are some matlab projects related to processing instrument signals still a lot of math you 100% would not be able tho to get into dsp without signals and systems the two are basically just 1 very long course imo split into 2 semesters Then def do it if you are interested! However let me warn you as someone who was 3 credits away from completing a (civil) engineering minor before giving up on it, you are required to take all of the freshmen engineering classes (calc chem physics 1&2....engineering 0011 & 0012) so definitely talk to an advisor first, since they may have gotten rid of that requirement (or it is only for civil engineering). But you'd have to talk to an advisor anyway to register for the ECE courses There is a single final project at the end but it was basically just create something related to any of the concepts we learned in any way shape or form. It was possibly the most disorganized CS class I've taken at pitt is it the same for ece minor? i never checked tbh It doesn't say on the website so I may be misinforming you all. I'd just talk to an advisor. In short don't minor in civil engineering even if you are really interested in dirt and rocks I most likely am wrong about that cant recommend enough, ask Dr. Dickerson, super nice guy Everyone I know who is in COE seems to enjoy it...even though they all just become software engineers after graduating lol i blame the fact pitt makes switching from CompE to cs or vice versa harder than it should be that goes back to university politics and the split of cs to sci and the reformatting of the ECE curriculum Swanson is just a very strange school in general old curriculum used to be much easier to switch from compe to cs or vice versa In freshman year ENGR 0012, which is like \"intro to engineering computing\" or whatever the languages are Matlab and then...C for some reason? Like just plain old C no C++ no python should def be matlab and python imo most core engineers wont use anything else if they even use those Not even ECE people use C in their classes because the only use of it is pretty much linux kernel development Not even ROS uses C ECE use either C++, Matlab, or Python usually Does not help compE gets mistaken for CS a lot by non technical people There's no psych minor, just something to be aware of Psych major also isn't that heavy tbh (especially if you don't do the honors thesis or bphil) i stand by it, gen eds r just a way for colleges to squeeze more money out of you so like, i'm going to buck the trend and say that you should not need a class to learn c++ (or any programming langauge tbh) c from 449 should be sufficient background for memory management stuff, and java should be okay for the object oriented parts and like, honestly learning how to write stuff in different languages by yourself (***without an llm***) is incredibly important the main thing to be aware of is that different languages have different paradigms, so like... don't try to write rust as though you're writing c or whatever i am once again appearing in the discord to shill for the coe minor it’s based the minor does not require any of the engineering gen eds Oh thats based. Civil requires call 1-3, diff eq, statics, mechanics, then you can take the 6 required courses. I think the reason I think that is statics has engr 0011 & 0012 as prereqs it is literally an almost 50 credit minor. Probably one of if not the largest at Pitt wow fuck that lmao coe was 1 course of like basic circuits and digital logic, followed by one course of embedded dev, then you get out of their DSA course with completion of 445, and then you get to do whatever electives you want i had two major complaints during my completion of it 1- you are locked into only the electives that are allowed by the minor. the list was like 12 ish courses so lots to chose from, but i asked them to let me into a grad course on nanofabrication and they wouldn’t let me and im still bitter 2-the architecture course did not expand my knowledge past what i already knew, BUT i am biased bc i had already completed three arch courses in SCI at that point and then my largest overall gripe with swanson in general is that i hate the overall vibe of “learning to use this piece of software” instead of learning concepts and how things work. this was particularly obvious in the fpga courses where we really just learned how to write vhdl and run it through vivado but nothing about synthesis, timing satisfaction, routing etc @Remy Sedlak feel free to dm me with questions abt the CoE minor fwiw having a CoE minor did come up in the interview for my job as a nice plus, but i don’t think it was particularly a deciding factor plus one on this btw dr dickerson was very approachable and helpful did u complete the minor pre or post restructure of the curriculum? oh god i think i finished my last of the coe minor innnnnnn spring 23’? did it look like this: (https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/departments/electrical-computer/undergraduate/computer-engineering/coe-minor/) yes! i took 201 and 202, got 302 waived bc of 445 and then took 1110 and 1195 Neat, imo 201 was a bit of a cringe class, 202 was alright but they were trying something new my year, 302 i slept through also 301 i slept through actually i slept through 201 aswell besides the lab, and 202, im kind of just really bad at going to class 201 was very boring bc i was already TAing 447 at that point but a free A is a free A 202 was semi interesting bc it was my first introduction to arm asm so i got some nice practice work in with it but also the programming concepts were the same as 447 atp so….. 201 was easy, the labs were bad in my section for a lot of people new to the subject cause there was only 1 useful TA and another who would just leave the other guy to do all the work And new prof who didnt know the labs either what’s 301 new prof is a cool guy has a stupid name, but is basically just intro to programming c++ variant, akin to the \"intermediate\" java class oh is that not what 302 was?? also are you CS major or CE major EE why’d you’d have to take 302 ohhhhh word used to be CompE gave up on that cause i had more friends in EE 302 is Data Structures and Algorithms (possibly why Sci has to call it algorithms and data structures) ok ya so CE301 is just CS401 and CE302 is CS445 never say ee 401, well now this makes no sense as a response that means something else horrible but basically and 302 does cover a little of algs 2, but is mostly a 445 equiv the content covered in my roomatee 1st 1501 exam was all stuff taught in 302 (at the end) ik"}

(lcoding language is python) Current student in Dr. Skeba's CS1675. The class is very work intensive, homeworks are grueling. But I don't think the class is very difficult in general. Understand a couple concepts, and the rest of the class is a breeze. like chris said 1571 focuses on good old-fashioned AI (GOFAI) that's predicated on logic and rules and is more deterministic, think video game NPCs/bosses/etc. whereas ML is a more probabilistic subset of AI used to make predictions based on prior training examples"}

Tbh I would recommend taking 445 if you don't plan on graduating early. Like if you know the material, it's an easy A, and keeps your free time open. Also technically speaking, content in 1501 isn't technically challenging. 1501 is mostly just trees, graphs, hashmaps and 1 extra topic (iirc currently it's ML with k nearest neighbors) which if you're used to programming, aren't hard conceptually difficulty comes from projects and if you want difficult projects, you can just open cmu website, pick random course, see if their assignments are public and go ahead The more interesting thing to do imo, is skip 445 and 1501 to go straight to 1510 lol both concepts and homeworks are decently challenging. And you can get away with not having any prereqs since a lot of the concepts are built from the ground up. they can @Aarash Zakeri and no you can't skip/test out of 445. take ramirez's section if you're actually trying to learn, he actually challenges you 445 made me a better programmer. Also I peer tutor 445 and the projects seems to vary between professors and they are all pretty cool and challenging. If you are trying to fast track stuff they let me take 445 and 1502 at the same time just email your advisor and Dr. Tan for permission you still have to end up taking all the major reqs before the school can graduate you tho Also if you don't have many AP or other hs college credits be wary of the minimum credits to graduate requirement, I have seen a LOT of people forget about it and then it messes with their schedule idk, it was a waste of time for me b/c mandatory attendance. I probably spent more time walking to class than doing work. TA'd for it later so not a total waste but still annoying there is one method that i'm aware of, and that's simply having existing college credit for an equivalent course (but obv you're still effectively \"taking 445\", just elsewhere) def agree with taking ramirez tho, the guy's a good lecturer imo and i feel like he cares more about \"developing good programming habits\", for lack of a better term, than most other 445 profs he *typically* teaches 445 and i think it's only in recent sems that he's focused on 401 and other classes, i believe same with farnan teaching 441 and similar instructor assignments as of late, and idk if these changes are permanent oooo ur right. go for tjames imo, he's a boss also heard good things about steve ellis Ellis is great Project 1 is a doozy though that's tjames, unless ellis is also at google? He is yeah Ye Pretty straight forward projects and labs, exams aren't too complex. yes, absolutely ramirez is teaching 445 over the summer, and then you could take 1501 in the fall"}

CMU has 15-150 as it's FP course but idk syllabus. To like get into Category theory seriously, you'll need a good grasp of topology. (The classic text for category theory is \"Categories for the Working Mathematican\" and it assumes knowledge group theory and topology from page 1) Here's a resource that helped me understand it better lol https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/ Also would recommend Math 1410: Intro to Foundations of Math. It talks about model theory and first order logic. You talk about syntax and semantics of a language in general, and first order logic as a specific case. you get to prove Godel's incompleteness theorem as well. From a category theory perspective, it's useful as the type theory part of category theory becomes easier if you're comfortable with undergrad level logic afaik most programs only offer category theory as a graduate class or at least an upper-level with a lot of prereqs; as ojas said you'll need to know topology but you'll also need a strong foundation in abstract algebra bartosz milewski is likely your best resource unless you're willing to put the time in to approach it from a mathematician's perspective instead of a computer scientist's for the math angle, try this: https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer12/curriculum.html you can ignore the university of oregon label, these are basically all (renowned) CMU professors. gets you into category theory and all of its adjacencies like type theory To my knowledge, MATH 2500 introduces category theory, but only to explain things in group theory and stuff.

Putnam seminar is an easy A, you just have to show up 1410 is tough but really fun. The most Intuitively fun part of abstract algebra is group theory i.e. The study of symmetries. Intuitively there's something similar about flipping a coin and rotating a square about it's diagonal. So we give this \"symmetry\" a name S2 (symmetric with 2 states). S2 is a group. In general abstract algebra is about what happens when you think of sets and operations on sets as a whole For SWE/ML specific focus option 1 is your best bet here specifically 1050,1101,1310 Option 2 is cool and challenging but they focus on more niche topics and less CS 1101 is relevant to ML/DL, that said i think a lot of these courses would be more relevant if you were interested in doing research/a phd in CS rather than just being an SWE I would avoid 1050, it's too broad to be applicable and the things you'll find useful will probably be taught in 1310 anyways oh also be warned for math 413/450.

{"text": "concept focused textbooks written resources for CMPINF0401 I've been having a lot of trouble with conceptual questions on midterms because we are taught the conceptual topics through projects, but I have been struggling because: -I usually rely on office hours to start programming as usually when I go after struggling on my own indefinitely I am told my pseudocode overcomplicated things, and am shown a different way to program it. However, because it's mostly verbal and within a time limit often I don't understand my notes explaining why we programmed a certain way or why a certain concept is important, as well as scribbling down notes during a conversation being difficult. A big issue is not having enough time to ask as many questions as I feel would help finally comprehend a certain topic + making mini projects vs turning in everything on time across classes even if I don't fully understand. I lose too many details/explanations to time and not really being able to visualize what was said. For anyone who has taken CMPINF0401 recently, what were good resources for overviewing topics such as array discipline, runtime cost efficiency /big O, etc? I know these are basic topics, but I feel it would help to have a book to go over them in depth. Changed the channel name: concept focused textbooks written resourced for CMPINF0401 Changed the channel name: concept focused textbooks written resources for CMPINF0401 There is a textbook but it is more for Java syntax whereas the conceptual concepts are supposed to be learnt through projects, but I feel it would be helpful if I had a textbook/resource for the conceptual concepts as I'm admittedly not comprehending the concepts through the projects due to time constrictions and misdirection when trying to learn a concept from scratch through just coding things. Specifically I've been struggling with array discipline, simplest ways to remove an element from an array, most cost effective way to upside or downsize an array, recognizing the big O runtime cost of an operation, the difference between a value, a reference and a variable and how the computer connects the three etc. Personally I've been struggling a lot with the project based structure since I end up glossing over the topics in order to figure out which code will work for the project now, but my pseudocode and mini projects are overcomplicated and messy. When we're supposed to learn these concepts when writing given program problems I \"don't know what I don't know \" conceptually, I just don't know how to write the code (and obviously cannot Google specifics for a project/algorithm) I've mainly been using navigate as well, but the main issue is resources for individual study. When I don't understand how an assigned program works and admittedly cannot google specifics of it, not understanding the concepts being used inside the assigned program then limits me from possibly googling more general ideas. I'm not sure how to develop this skill of being able to recognize the algorithmic concepts in an assigned project to then research further as a beginner.", "answers": "Is there a textbook for the class assigned? Does 401 even do big O now? I thought that was basically a 1501 thing Also what do you mean by array discipline? I would find a tutor if you got time for it. It sounds like office hours isn't enough time for you to fully comprehend stuff. Not understanding the code you're writing sounds like the worse problem to me Textbook and Google is what where I would go to if you're not grasping the concept I'm guessing it's Hoffman's class(I may be wrong but it sounds like the things he taught), he put Big O in midterm and don't do a good job explaining it ??? In 401? Lol That's horrible What concepts are you struggling with specifically? I'll try to give a detailed answer in a bit, laying down ATM tho For understanding your assignment programs. What I'd normally do for understanding the functionality of the program is to start by figuring out what each method is doing. Each method is trying to accomplish a specific thing. You'll need to figure out what it is trying to do and more specifically how it is doing. A lot of the times there's no better way than just look at the code line by line and trying to make sense what they are doing. Then how they chain together to accomplish the specific task. Normally for assignments the professor and/or the TA would give you an basic idea on how to do what is asked for to the assignment. Like there isn't much I can advice on how to translate the steps to solve a problem into code since it depends on the assignment. If you can't understand why the algorithms works, try to come up with examples for the input and trace through the steps and see how that would give you the desired output. I'll go point by point: - i don't know what you mean by \"effectively upsizing/downsizing an array\" because arrays in java have immutable length... - a value is the actual data (e.g. 5, \"abc\" or an actual instantiation of an object). a reference \"points to\" the data beneath it (object variables in java are always references). a variable is a way to refer to data while writing your code. In Java, variables are either a *value type* (int, float, byte, etc) or a *reference type* (Object, Array, String, HashMap, etc)... a variable of any reference type (basically, a variable for any Object or Object subclass) is actually a *reference to the underlying value* (essentially, it's an implicit *pointer* to the underlying data... it basically is an address that tells the computer where to go to find the data). Yes, this is confusing and yes, java is dumb. -- Additionally, java passes *all* function parameters *by value*, which means they are copied to the function being called. q: \"But wait! how does this work for Objects like Arrays? does that mean the whole thing is copied??\" a: the *reference* (which is the address of the underlying data) is copied, not the underlying data. This will become more clear when you take CS449 when they talk about pointers. -- Don't worry too much about how the computer connects them yet, you'll learn more about that in 447 and 449. Essentailly with java though, the compiler will read your code and turn it into a set of machine independent instructions. These instructions are then read by the java runtime environment and are executed. Note that some other programming languages, such as scripting languages like Python, skip the compilation step and just are \"interpreted\" by their virtual machine and are run on the fly. Other *compiled* languages like C, C++, Rust and Go, will directly compile to the underlying machine code and run directly on the processor (through the OS) rather than through the java virtual machine. - For Big O/runtime stuff, essentially what you're trying to do is generalize how much \"work\" it will take to run an algorithm on a set of data. There's many ways of doing it but you essentially want to look at how many times a loop will run or a recursive function will be called for an arbitrarily sized input. For example: ```java /* this has O(n^2) complexity */ public void doSomething(int[] arr) { int n = arr.length; for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { //do something } } } /* this has O(n) complexity */ public void doSomethingElse(int[] arr) { int n = arr.length; for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // do something } } /* assume arr is sorted, return the index of val or -1 if not found; this is O(lg(n)) because it keeps dividing the size it's looking at in half each time it executes through the loop */ public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int val) { int n = arr.length; int left = 0; int right = n - 1; while (left <= right) { int mid = (left + right) / 2; if (arr[mid] < val) { left = mid + 1; } else if (arr[mid] > val) { right = mid - 1; } else { return mid; } } return -1; } ``` um, for projects, i'd recommend just doing them a step at a time.... like one function at a time or whatever i haven't done a small project in a while bc in my phd program the class just makes you write the entire program and at work i'm either writing fully new tools or making changes to existing ones and testing them out but i'd take the approach of do something small, test it and see if it's working or not, and if not, try to figure out why with this, i would check through the slides and read through the given code of the assignment to see what it wants you to do a lot of times in courses where scaffold/example code is given (lower level courses), there will be comments telling you what to do and what needs to be done and also comments saying what the existing parts are doing > Essentailly with java though, the compiler will read your code and turn it into a set of machine independent instructions. These instructions are then read by the java runtime environment and are executed. Note that some other programming languages, such as scripting languages like Python, skip the compilation step and just are \"interpreted\" by their virtual machine and are run on the fly. to clarify this: you're writing a program that turns into instructions for *another program* to read and execute for projects making diagrams is helpful"}

I think he's an infamously disorganized professor, and his class organization was definitely not great. We went over principles of comp bio, which involves data science, statistics, and ML principles and their application to various biological prooblems. I think the course serves its function well enough. When I took the course, we completed various guided projects/tasks in R (basically fill in the blank) and went over stuff like how to use R, and then data sci principles like data cleaning, imputation, analysis (histograms, scatter plots, regressions, PCA, clustering) and some other stuff on a pretty shallow level. I believe the course is now taught in python 1542 (comp genomics)- I took the genomics option, we covered pretty much entirely linux/bash tools on the CRC cluster. Most of the class was analysis of bulk biological data, such as manipulating genome files, analyzing RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, sequence alignment, etc. I didn't find the content to be super interesting unfortunately, although Dr. Miler Lee is a great teacher and super friendly. Most of the hw is remote computing on the CRC, with 2 projects that use a bit of R (with the option to do it in Python instead, although I was the only one in the class to choose that ). BIOSC1640- Computational biology research (VERY SPECIFIC TO PROFESSOR) I took this class with Dr. Durrant and I found it super interesting. Everyone was assigned a protein, and we went through a mini drug-discovery pipeline. It consisted of identifying ligands for that protein, doing some rendering/analysis protein-ligand binding, using compound libraries to identify potential target molecules, simulating the docking of those molecules, etc. Most of the work is done in browser-based software developed by Dr. Durrant's lab, as well as some guided tutorials in python notebooks for using python packages like pymol/pymol3d, some machine learning tutorials w/scikitlearn, etc. I heard from classmates that who took this course with Dr. Lee that the content was a lot more aligned with Dr. Lee's research, so think similar stuff to 1542. I would imagine that 1544 which is usually taught by Dr. Durrant would cover stuff more in line with my experiences in 1640 There's also CS1640, which is an option for the comp-bio capstone, but I switched from that to BIOSC1640. It was the same course as another CS capstone class (i believe it was 1980?), so it felt like \"CS capstone and also there are comp bio majors here\". It's a team-based semester long project where you work with faculty or industry teams, and there are bioinformatics/biotech options for your project but it's not really enforced/reserved for comp-bio students afaik. If you want to lean more CS/internshippy side then that's probably a good option, but it was not what I was looking for at all so I dropped it. No problem! My personal observation was that the major has a bunch of pre-med/dental/health students in it, and all things considered the CS portion is actually very light. I ended up taking linear algebra and calc 3 pass/fail, and also took intro to machine learning at CMU (super difficult course but the knowledge has come into play multiple times so far in my research)"}

{"text": "Could you touch the grinch with a 39.5 foot mobius strip Like the song doesn’t specify anything about the distance. So, you could have a robot hold a 39.5 foot pole while you controlled him from outer space and still you wouldn’t touch the grinch. But it does seem like a 39.51 foot pole is okay. What about the limit as l approaches 39.5+? What if the pole is nonEuclidean? What if the pole is not actually a pole but a string vibrating so it seems like a pole? what an excellent and eloquent observation professor tau i still don't understand why the specificity of 39.5 like why not just say 40 \"I wouldn't touch you with a 39 but infinitely approaching but never actually reaching 40 foot pole\"", "answers": "fascinating… what if the pole was made by the grinch? so it was able to touch him while it was being made, so why not now? Take the pole's length as distance from nearest object in controllable communication with you. It seems likely that the grinch produces a harmful field that is conducted through communication signals. The harm it produces is either symptomatic over long periods of time or very dependent on the biology of the efectee. We see that the Who's have no adverse effects after being close to Grinch after ~8 hours and no apparent affects with the grinch living in proximity to them for many years (Seuss 1957). Given the large variation in potential pole, we can conclude 39.5ft is an approximation probably skewing toward a higher value. This is furthered supported by it's appearance in \"You're a mean one Mr. Grinch\", which we can tell by it's title is not an objective or scientific evaluation of the dangers posed by the Grinch. 40 is his limit beyond that the grinch is powerless Using 40 would seem like the techniques used to find it had low resolution thus 39.5 used to make it feel more precise."}

This is my first time TAing so I've no clue what I should expect, but I have completed all the core CS courses up until CS 1501 with Farnan, so in terms of foundations I should be good to go.

The canvas on the staff training recommended that we should contact the instructor beforehand for office hours details, but I haven't heard anything about canvas invites or anything like that so I just wanted to double check that I'm on track Thank you I took a look at the file and saw that the first project, \"Spacecraft,\" was empty - is that intended or are there missing resources? And also, will we be expecting to translate program setups between different OSes like mac/windows/linux? I should be able to just ask the professor for all the materials right? oh gotcha cool thank you so i should probably be following the professor right? but i mean i don't actually have to tinker with mu since the students will be the ones using it or should i also handle maintenance and setups when it comes to that i used notepad++ for my first and second semesters at pitt everyone was flaming on me for not using vscode lmao dangg alright sounds good i guess if i don't understand stuff they ask me, i can always redirect it to the professor right? worst case scenario  i will be looking forward to working with you also congratulations on being a peer tutor, the responsibilities sounds like a lot and that's impressive honestly i'd be scared because there are a lot of things you need to juggle with being a peer tutor as opposed to just being a ta so it's commendable for sure actually i saw one of your slides about bmp files did you make that to help the students out or is that something else? cuz i know in some of the higher but still core courses of the cs department the TA is required to lecture oh wow! that's awesome dude so what you did was just to go through all of the powerpoints with the students basically gotcha yeah definitely, i mean hey i might do that too for the sake of public speaking practice 🤣 you can never get enough professional practice got it thanks again i really appreciate the help yup, see you tomorrow", "answers": "Hello!

If you don’t meet with the professor and they’ll add you. Yeah, first lab I just told everyone to get vscode or notepad++ tbh lol Projects 2 and 3 are by far the hardest projects, so I'd expect a ton of students to show up during ohs Yeah, they'll be taught how to use it in class I'm pretty sure easier to just do that it shouldn't be an issue - mu is only slightly more advanced than block coding that's what I did, so yeah, nothing embarassing with doing that Or you can redirect them to me I'm a peer tutor this semester eh, I'm doing all the lower levels, so I'm pretty happy about that You can run labs however you like so that’s pretty chill You DO NOT need to lecture unless the professor instructs you to do a hands-one or asks you to make a announcement (rare) I lectured every lab, which was actually unnecessary for CS 11 The PowerPoints made it easy to do that I mean, it was good practice to speak in front of people I’ll tell you that That’s basically what I did It’s up to you, but I’d recommend you to just go over what the class is class is struggling with, makes it much easier Maybe give them 10 minutes to look over the lab and form groups, then come up with some questions Then you can selectively lecture on topics No problem, feel free dm me at any point in the semester if you’re having trouble Also, I will see you tomorrow at the TA/PT Onboarding meeting I'm TAing for the class too!"}

Bio PhD idk but we did cover some algorithms and their proofs that are used in Comp. Bio. I would take a light course load as Maddie suggested. I took 1510 + 1550 + 1674 (CV) for reference and I did fine in all three if you did wanna take it in the spring, you could take grad algorithms instead /j lol grad algorithms sucks so bad\\ i've also heard that it's truly not a great time anyway, see https://discord.com/channels/729022532874797146/1278027944916287508 for my review of 1510 so i don't have to repeat myself 1510 is as hard as you make it tbh. you can coast doing all the 2 pt questions on every hw and doing the easy B question on every quiz and get a B if you participate in class. Although i don't recommend that since you the topics are act. pretty interesting and the harder hw qs were kinda fun imo, like puzzles. plus its encouraged to work in groups which is fun as well. The way I’ve seen it described is 1510 is like 1501 and 1511 is more akin to 1502. I haven’t taken 1511 tho so I am not sure. 1510 is a lot of algorithms and their proofs (how to prove algorithms and design them etc) this is correct, 1511 is complexity theory and stuff like that also, you don't really learn that many algorithms in 1510, cuz again you're the one coming up with the algorithms most of the time Also note that 1510 is fall only"}

{"text": "CS 1511 Theory of Computation 1511 is probably the hardest class in the major; luckily, it's also one of the easiest to get a good grade in. Pruhs has a policy where if you show up to class and do/attempt the homeworks, he gives you a B automatically. If you do well, he gives you an A. I found this to be very helpful, as it allowed us to tackle hard problems in a much lower-stress environment. I really loved the class - there's a lot of cool stuff you cover in it you'd never find mention of anywhere else (or at least, I didn't). Homework is also done in groups you form at the start of the semester, one writeup per group - having a good group will be really critical to having a good experience. Moreso making sure everyone has a good mindset and gets along - if you're like my group was, you'll spend a lot of time together outside of class banging your heads against the homework. Be prepared to struggle! Don't be intimidated - your grade should be fine, and you'll learn a bunch. But it is challenging to be sure You're welcome! No Tan's 1502 *is* pretty easy (as is 1632) I don't even remember if you're allowed to work alone? I forget if groups were automatically assigned or not. 1511 is ***hard***. I mean, you could probably still get a B on your own? Because you tried. But you would struggle way more Yeah it’s been a year since I took his classes, he could have changed his setup. I think quizzes were only a thing in 1510, not 1511, though, so that could make a difference? I defer to those who took them more recently", "answers": "tysm for the input! do you think it's viable to work alone? i got an A+ in 1632 and an A in 1675 working alone on homeworks, even though both of those classes allow working in groups for homework assignments I'm not entirely sure if this grading policy is still the same. This semester in 1510, he changed the policy where you were guaranteed a **C**, and needed to do somewhat well on quizzes to get a **B**, and do well in quizzes to get an **A** what about homeworks? for an A you should attempt the 8 or 6 point question almost all weeks and a B you'd do the other 2-4 point questions. Each homework had 3 to 4 questions each worth 2-8 points and you could only choose one to do. Which was similar to the quizzes which were two questions one 10 point and one 20 point and you could only choose one to answer For anyone currently in 1511, what's the class looking like so far? Would it be possible for someone to give a general description of the class structure/grading (given that it might have changed as someone said previously)? From the syllabus it seems like the B rule still stands at a B if you put in the effort (attend lecture, try on hw, participate) and an A if you show “mastery of the material” No quizzes, a final, weekly hw done using latex Lectures are Dr. Pruhs writing notes, lots of class participation. He randomly calls on people. He’s understanding if you don’t know the answer He tries to organize the lectures around the Socratic Method he says on the syllabus which seems pretty accurate so far"}

{"text": "CS 1675 vs CS 1503 I have heard that CS 1503 - Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning, is a relatively simple intro class to machine learning. But I've also heard that CS 1675 - Intro to Machine Learning, is also an introduction course, yet is much harder. Is CS 1503 a prereq to CS 1675? Which class should I take if I'm only concerned about practicality in grad school? For reference I am highly considering Pitt's Comp Bio program. I took stat 1151 and that class ended up being quite a handful alongside 1501 , ended up barely failing But I do have Stat 1000 from ap credits, that still means I fulfill the prereqs right? Alright, I think I'll take cs 1675 instead Is the class offered in the spring?

Old reqs", "answers": "Only pre-reqs for 1675 are 1501 and a Stat class (1000, 1100, 1151). If you’re interested in ML I’d say skip 1503 and just take 1675 (unless ofc you’re req to take 1503 due to the new major requirements) otherwise 1503 is probably a good intro to get a good idea about what ML is. If you do take 1675, I’d highly recommend taking stat 1151 makes visualizing and understanding all the probability distributions much easier. Id assume so yes. Afaik yes Personally found it harder than 1550 just due to the number of hours needed. But I took it w Yurko and now it’s taught by Skeba so maybe it’s different ML is math and statistics based. I’m in grad AI rn and so far it’s mostly algorithms skeba 1675 still a time suck Idk about undergrad ai its different than 1550 it just takes a long time to do the assignments i didnt find the concepts as hard tho u still code in r but its not as focused on the coding bit @Andrew Chen are you on the old grad reqs or the new reqs? then you don't really need to take 1503 1503 is mostly a math/stats class from what i've seen, as prep for further ML coursework you def should know the material for stat 1000 and 1151 for 1675, tho at least when i took it with yurko, there *were* some purely math hw problems mixed with the r coding, usually derivations of formulas yep still have em w skeba then you'll wanna remember how derivatives and logarithms work lmao @Andrew Chen most of the actual mathematical concepts in 1675 are manageable and familiar, just tedious Half of AI is graph theory i feel like that's less true for DL and much of ML, but a lot of AI def is yeah, ml and dl def more math and stats where ai is like graphs and fol ML is only a subset of AI that cs 1571 barely touches upon (only towards the end) most of 1571 is logic- and rule-based AI (good old-fashioned AI or GOFAI) 1571 contains a few 1675 concepts, but 1675 doesn't contain any 1571 concepts if you're concerned about practicality in grad school, i would skip 1503 and just take 1675 i took 1675 w/o having taken stat 1151 or linear and still got an A (w/ yurko) the difficulty of 1675 stems more from the sheer *amount* of work there is rather than intrinsic difficulty of the material"}

Very theory and math heavy. Weekly homeworks with two exams, and a project at the end of the semester. Not terribly hard but fairly time consuming (mostly on homeworks). everything is in R lol Most homeworks are programming assignment, aside for a couple week where there's a lot math derivation also. It's all in R unless he changes it the language of statistics is R esp academia industry-wise i have not seen much R at all tho mainly python there Skeba started teaching last semester, don't think he have time to rework the class into Python even if he wants to yes lemme try and remember what it is lol hm maybe it is not offered anymore but i took it as stat 1294 (basically an experimental stats class) which is akin to stat 1261 but in python and is called \"data science in python\" you'll get the same thing out of stat 1261 though so but that's taught in R highly rec stat 1361 if ur interested in ml+ds though i think cs has a sister version of the class so you may be able to get it to count towards a cs major with that i think it is literally 1675 I took this class last semester In which Yurko taught the first 3 weeks. The reasoning he gave was that there are abstractions in the popular Python libraries that either give a little less control or doesn’t make you have to know what’s going on. There is no expectation that you have written R before (this was the case for me) there are a bunch of resources It was time consuming but I liked the class bc the lectures are math and theoretical but then the homework is the same concepts you just learned and you apply it so it reinforces what you talked about and Skeba was very nice and cared about people actually learning what was going on as opposed to every fine grain detail of the math Sorry rambling. At the same time, you do have to understand the overall concept of the math to get why everything works the way it does i imagine the former Yeah. Depends on what cool is for you. I thought it was “cool” to see it become relevant to some examples and helpful but not super cool. The final project is on real company data that you don’t know what the outcome metrics even are CS 1678 does it’s in PyTorch Not really imo they’re very different courses in terms of how they approach teaching ML so it would prob be fine. The majority of ML is spent learning methods before Neural networks (SVM, Bayesian etc) and the majority of DL is spent learning deep neural networks. i am taking stat 1361 now; would you recommend taking cs 1675 on top of that or is there lots of content overlap? @🅱 o n k (tianyi zheng) took both!! i think either way, im sure hell have a better insight than me he did! i am looking at our message history looks like i asked him about the differences a year ago 🫠"}

{"text": "CS1550 I'm interested in taking CS 1550 next spring. Out of the three listed professors: Khattab, Misurda, and Debarun Das, which one is the best in terms of learning and gaining knowledge? I don't mind a difficult professor and I don't mind working harder for a better grade for 1550, I'd take the professor who prioritizes learning over everything else. Ohh i see, i mustve misread it So just how much of a difficulty jump is it from taking it with Khattab to Misurda? can you quantify that? like let's say you get an A- with Khattab, what would the reduction be with Misurda (assuming you put in the same amount of effort) and i suppose you still learn a lot in comparison to Misurda? i see, thank you so much Misurda sounds very daunting tbh I appreciate your help though, that was very informative Thank you Did you feel traumatized because he was \"mean\"? Or was it because his classes are just unreasonably difficult? What do you mean by gaslight? Trying to prove that your performance in class was terrible? \"prove\" Also, since I'm taking 449 with luis right now, do you think I'm going to have a better chance at understanding/keeping up with Misurda's 1550 section? Since I think luis is regarded as quite a difficult professor overall wow.. so are we expected to learn by ourselves with misurda's class? even though he's a great lecturer overall What the hell? I heard that you're supposed to learn file systems in 1550, but he left that as a project and never talked about it? I think that's beyond unreasonable for a professor Ah I see, so is he similar to how farnan teaches things? if you've taken any of his classes before hmm i see so if you were to pick between misurda and khattab, i guess you would pick khattab? ohh wow misurda did? how dare he yeah especially if misurda's classes are devastating apparently not for this year yeah cuz i'm taking 1501 with Farnan right now what about 22787 and 23541? that's with misurda alright, thank you again oh yeah, what about him teaching only one section though? alright awesome i'm sold oh it's fine i'm gonna go for misurda probably i would rather learn more than just pass the class without learning much lmao yes you can yeah definitely i honestly got into farnan's 1501 by chance and he's an amazing professor so i guess i was lucky Oooh that sounds great! Really? That sounds promising In terms of difficulty, how much more/less difficult is it compared to 1501? I know that these two courses talks about very different things but how much more difficult is it from the easier courses in the sequence (i.e. 445 to 1501 and 449 to 1550)? ohh that explains the difficulty of his sections described by the people earlier what if i'm taking 18 is it really that bad? Oh, no don’t worry I’m taking 1501 right now, i have cs 1656 and 1502 next semester though Lmao i had no idea about farnan but i do think that he’s a great professor and I’m learning a lot from him Yeah def but i heard that you don’t really learn much from him What other courses were you taking 1550 with? Oh okay so 3 stem courses? That’s not too bad I’m assuming your office hours werent that busy and you were able to work on your projects/assignments I’m planning to take these courses next semester: CS 1502 CS 1550 CS 1656 ENGCMP 200 INFSCI 1023 - some comm gen ed STAT 1152 I’m also applying to be a TA for one section next semester What do you think? Ah How did you manage during that semester? And were you satisfied with your grades Ahh I guess one bad semester doesn’t really affect your overall GPA right? Well “bad” relatively Oh gotcha How important is GPA anyway? Assuming you’re not using it for grad school And also is it possible for you to estimate the feasibility of this? I get that it depends from person to person but maybe from a general standpoint? So assuming if i can stay ahead with the hws and dedicate my time to doing the 1550 projects, it should be good for those 3 ? Ohh yeah that makes sense Also how lengthy are the engcmp assignments? It depends on the section right Oh Did you take any other engcmp class?? Oh yeah I’m planning to take that as well Well not next semester but the next next one Yeah, is that difficult? I heard it’s mostly just writing professional letters Alright that’s good Is it crazy to take all these classes at once or is it normal you think? I guess “normal” to an extent Right i saw the guide for csc’s “normal” semesters Yeah that’s true I guess if you really wanna take 18 credit semesters you’ll have to be at the top of your game Steamrolling through back to back assignments while keeping track of everything else Thank you that was informative So I’m a sophomore right now, my first sem i took 15, second 17, this sem 18 I’m currently struggling but i guess that’s because im taking 5 stem courses (stat 1151, cs 447/449/1501, math 0280) and 1 gen ed, also I’m pretty sure my schedule for next semester is easier I think once i get time management down and that i can stay on top of everything else, then my semester can go smoothly The repetitive weekly hws and labs paired with the long projects are a killer though yeah i'm doing a data science and compsci double major oh haha my enrollment date is nov 6... oh god, are there no TAs around? thankfully i planned to take misurda's section well nevertheless i'm going to have to take either section anyway ah okay awesome, do you think those TAs will still be around? yes for sure noted, thank you", "answers": "I think Debarun is the TA Debarun Das is actually Dr. Khattab's TA, so there are actually only two professors: Dr. Khattab and Dr. Misurda. Dr. Khattab teaches one section next spring, and Dr. Misurda teaches the other two. In terms of learning and gaining knowledge, Dr. Misurda would be better than Dr. Khattab. However, based on my own personal experience from the spring 2023 semester, even though he is an amazing lecturer, I personally found him to be extremely aggressive and mean to me during his office hours when I was discussing my performance in the class with him. I have heard that he has mellowed out a little bit over the last couple of years, but if you do decided to take 1550 with Misurda, I would definitely make sure that you attend every lecture, pay attention, and start projects early. Personally for me, I took 1550 for the first time with Misurda in Spring 2023 and had to withdraw from the class due to being extremely overwhelmed with the content and assignments. I then retook 1550 with Khattab in Spring 2024 and managed to pass with a B+. Based on what I experienced, the difficulty jump is pretty extreme. With Dr. Khattab, I struggled significantly with two projects and both the midterm and final exam; however, he does grade leniently and give a generous amount of extra credit at the end of the semester, so I still pulled off a B+. From what I have heard from others and based on my own experiences, Dr. Khattab is not the best lecturer, but that does not necessarily mean that you won't learn from his class. To answer this question, when I took 1550 with Misurda, the projects were much more difficult that Khattab's projects. Khattab's projects are relatively straight-forwards if you read the pseudocode give in the slides during lecture and recitation. However, with Misurda's projects, you will have very little to no background given directly from lecture, meaning you will have to look up a significant amount of documentation online to be able to complete the projects. Dr. Misurda also gives pop-quizzes during recitations, and his lecture slides are limited in material to the point that there is no way to make up the information if you miss lecture. When I took 1550 with Misurda, I had a 51.2% F in the class right before I withdrew, and I was told the class would get significantly more difficult in the second half of the semester. If you have any other question about whether you want to take 1550 with Misurda or Khattab, then please feel free to ask any specific questions here. I took 1550 with both professors and can give you my take on whatever question you ask. I would say the grade reduction would be at least two entire letter grades, but that's just my approximation. Yeah. To be fair, when I came out of his office hours, I felt traumatized and even cried. Yeah. He was constantly very aggressive and mean to me during his office hours when I wanted to discuss my performance in the class, and I think he was even trying to gaslight me. When he asked me why I didn’t do so good on the first project (I got a 51%.), I explained that I didn’t start it early enough and had to look up a lot of documentation online to be able to do the project. His reply was, “I told you everything you needed to know for that project in lecture and in the write-up. You did not need to look up a single thing online.” Upon asking my classmates about the project, they told me that they had to teach themselves more than they ever had to for any project up to that point in their CS career. There were definitely some other examples, but this one is by far the most convincing in my mind. Yeah. For example, from what I heard from other students, the final project in the class was to implement a file system, and he never talked anything about file systems in lecture until after the project was due. He talks about a lot of high level conceptual ideas during lecture that are helpful for the exams and quizzes, but he rarely discusses low level concepts needed for the projects in lecture. Yeah. And he only started talking about file systems at a conceptual level 10-15 minutes before the end of the last lecture of the semester. I’ve never taken any classes with Dr. Farnan, so I really can’t say anything about Dr. Farnan. I like Farnan Farnan is cool anyways bye From what I heard, 449 was restructured the semester after I took 449, so the version of 449 I took I heard was likely much easier than the version you are in right now. Misurda was the one who restructured it for basically all professors. So, I think you may have a better chance at keeping up with Misurda in 1550 than I did. I haven’t had misurda but it doesn’t sound like it I’ve definitely done the projects for Farnan’s 1501 only using my notes from his class isnt khattab only teaching one section in spring i only see one section on that image Personally, I would choose Khattab. However, you may also want to ask some students who took 1550 with Misurda more recently since I have heard he has mellowed out a little bit over the last two years. And everything I said is only my personal opinion based on what I experienced in Spring 2023. yeah i said khattab not misurda Same argument as Farnan vs Khattab. Want to learn go Misurda, want to pass without learning much go Khattab its gonna be much harder to get into half the seats are already taken Id at least try out Misurda to see if his teaching style works for you. ive avoided khattab once i can do it again yeah thats why i took farnan for 1501 he's a very good lecturer :youngfarnan: I liked Misurdas projects, they were different from a lot of the other types of projects you run into at Pitt. First one (graphics library) was a real wake up for sure and resulted in me reading a lot of C docs which was rough at first but now that im an actual SWE im reading documentation a lot I have Misurda rn and I'm guessing he must've changed a ton cuz he seems super approachable now, his projects have pretty detailed descriptions and have been straightforward so far, and his midterm was graded pretty fairly imo. So far 1550 with him is def my favorite class I've taken at Pitt, would highly recommend +1, am also in this class right now and he is such a fantastic lecturer I would say about the same. I would say 1550 is considerably more difficult than 1501, but the difference is not insane. This trade off haunts pitt cs There’s also Bonidie vs Garrison Misurda is the goat of OS, just don't expect to have a high grade in that class lmao he has that kind of influence cuz he's more senior in the dept than you think. he used to be a prof at pitt years ago, being the main 449 prof. he left for UArizona years ago and only came back to pitt a few years ago to teach systems classes like 449 and 1550 again, so i'm pretty sure the dept is basically treating him as the most senior teaching prof when it comes to those classes I saw this exact response on Misurda's rmp, that was you right? afaik there was only 1 (?) 449 prof after misurda left and before oliveira took over teaching the class, and i can attest that that prof was Not Good™️ and kinda fucked with the 449 curriculum Dawg, I asked Misurda about his grading criteria and he yelled at me \"why do you care how I grade the class?\" Yeah! There was this time when I stood outside his office when he was assisting another student. He saw me and told me to \"get out of his sight so he could focus\". I sat down outsidt his office and he told me \"how about you actually get out of my sight\". 🫠 No way he's mellowed out, people who say that are capping🧢 Yeah, that’s what I was talking about earlier when I said that Misurda redid the 449 curriculum after the Fall 2022 semester, the semester after I took 449, when he realized that his curriculum was significantly altered after he left Pitt. he will not discuss grades no matter what it's a strange policy of his Maybe he was even worse in previous semesters, I never had him before os 🤷 I personally didn't find it too hard to keep up in the class. I just got covid during the 2nd syscalls project and that messed me up. You really don't learn anything from bonidie Don't feel too bad, I had to spend up to 10 hours just doing the research for that project IMHO, I think Misurda 1550 is very doable, just don't expect any leniency from him and prepare to sweat your butt off for the projects. And don't take more than 15 credits that semester 🫠 I made the mistake of taking 17 credits that semester where I took Misurda 1550… And three of those credits came from arguably the most challenging required class for ECE majors since I was also working on my EE minor in addition to my CS major at the time. What other classes do you have? Umm, maybe reconsider 1501 + 1550 are so time consuming and draining And if you’re coding skills aren’t the best, you’ll struggle even more Farnan and Misurda are both hardasses I think OP is taking 1501 with Farnan this fall semester. Even worse, why don’t you do khattab for both lmaoo ^ Khattab 1501 + 1550 That’ll be more than manageable Khattab is a saint when it comes to cs professors i took 1550 while taking 18 credits, def doable but it really sucks depending on what other classes and commitments you have @Andrew Chen: I think OP is taking 1501 with Farnan this fall semester and is thinking about taking 1550 next spring semester. So OP won’t be taking 1501 and 1550 simultaneously. Ah, I see Thanks for the clarification i was taking 1550 with a math class, a stats class, a language class, and some gen ed classes i was also TAing 3 sections that sem only some, the OH for my cs classes weren't that busy but i was basically always busy for my OH for the non-cs class that i was TAing > How did you manage during that semester? somehow i did, not without a lot of suffering (@Nathan Barta took 1550 with me and can attest) > And were you satisfied with your grades i think my grades ended up being fine, they were lower than prev sems and that sem dragged my gpa down, but ultimately they weren't that bad my grades were still fine that sem so my overall gpa only dropped very little, so i wasn't too concerned i can't speak to 1656, freshman comp, or the infosci class, but the others look a bit rough taken together, ngl 1502 and 1152 aren't *super* difficult, but their (weekly?) hws are kinda time-consuming and annoying you'll have to keep that in mind when you also have 1550 projects and whatever writing assignments you have for freshman comp 1. unless it's actually bad, nobody really cares, most people consider 3.0+ to be good enough, i'd say 2. i was applying to grad school that sem as well so gpa def mattered for me yeah idk, i didn't take engcmp 200 at pitt i skipped it with ap credit i took engcmp 400 for the business/technical/professional writing gen ed req, if that counts that's a diff class for a diff req, tho pretty sure it's a very prof-dependent class too, but for me the class was quite ez, not that much work i'm not a good judge of what a \"normal\" workload is, but i'd say prob not, simply cuz most people stick to 15-credit semesters idk your time management skills and workload tolerance so i can't say for certain how many creds have you been taking per sem thus far? cuz if you've already been taking 6 classes at 16–18 creds and you're doing ok thus far, then it's prob safe to say that you'll do ok with that schedule for next sem 1151 made no sense to me lol Are you data science? Hope you got in to the section you wanted cuz now it’s only misurda I thought Khattab was doing 1 section? Yeah…it filled up today, so anyone who still hasn’t enrolled yet for 1550 but plans to enroll in Khattab’s section is screwed. Misurda def doable, albeit will be a much different experience I will say that you’ll most likely have to throw away your pride in OHs to get anywhere cuz he will clown on you if you’re stubborn There are TAs in Misurda’s sections. The one I had when I took 1550 with Misurda was really nice and knowledgeable, so definitely take advantage of TA office hours as much as possible. Honestly I’m not too sure. However, regardless of who the TAs are, definitely take advantage of their office hours as much as possible when you take Misurda 1550. The TAs will definitely be able to help you with the projects a lot more than Misurda will. i'd drop one of the STEM courses tbh, that's a lot"}

Math 0290 prob not the way to go for cs. It’s definitely geared more towards practical engineering applications than anything. Definitely take linear algebra though, lots of applications in machine learning. Afaik machine learning does use calculus 3 stuff (gradients) but it’s pretty basic to learn on your own and not worth taking calculus 3/diff eq to understand it calc 3 is relevant for any post-introductory level ML imo idk about whats in the stats for cs, but they might as well put multvar calc in that. especially considering now that calc 2 is no longer needed? probabilty theory is not grad reqs. idk where you learnt that they do have stat 1000, but that has been repalced by cs stats class yep. there is 0 chance they redesign calc 2, but I would have put in multivariable calc, and deemphasized stuff like diffyq and integration technique and series stuff. i just feel like multvar is insanely important, we should teach it sooner, especially if ppl aren't going to be taking calc 3. I would be fine tossing out some less relevant content from calc2, and moving it to calc 3. and maybe my intuition is off on this, but calc 2 isn't really essential to doing well in calc 3. stat 1151 has a calc 2 prereq yeah, it used to be one way to satisfy the stats requirement for the CS major (the other ways being stat 1000 and stat 1100) but the stats requirement has now been replaced with cs 1503 there are lots of multiple integrals and stuff in calc 3 tho so you need a solid integration background i haven't taken calc 3, so someone else would know better. disregard what I said then. this is like, fundamentally not possible with how calculus is taught though, like calc 3 (multivariable) is essentially applying differentiation and integration over multiple dimensions why not? integration and differentiation are taught in calc1. yes multiple dimensions is new, but thats the point. introduce it. calc 1 focuses on differentiation (tiny bit of integration at the end) while calc 2 is the one that goes in-depth on (single variable) integration hot take, I thinking knowing how to take a partial derivative is more important than drilling 1 variable integration problems. it's been a while since i took calc 1 and calc 2 but like tbf calc 2 does some partial derivatives also (at least my calc 2 class did) iirc, calc 1 going into integration is like... super super early/simple integration i asked a grad stats student once if they ever did trig sub outside of learning calc. their answer was \"maybe on my preliminary\". I don't think trig sub is required to start teaching multvar. the goal isn't to make everyone into a calc expert, just enough to not be lost when it shows up in other classes (likely with refresher and explanation) I always thought calc 2 should be split into 2 different classes so... i'm just fundamentally unsure that proposing changes to the structure of a series of three classes that actually *need* to be taken in series is going to be effective if you have never actually completed the sequence of courses that you want to change integrals are harder than derivatives and the rules are the same fair, but I think I've encountered multivariable in the CS more than I encountered radius of convergence, or trig sub, or hyperbolic. so based on trying to cover what students might need in the future, i do it's not unreasonable to ask for it to take priority over these topics. a good counter example would be to show an instance in CS where these topics are crucial to know. I did all my calc outside Pitt so idk about how tailored the courses are but I never felt that there was a significant benefit from taking Calc vs having conceptual knowledge and learning the necessary parts for each course keeping in mind that engineers takes these classes, i do see a far more reasonable case for these things tho. i mean at my job (and in my research), i work on distributed systems and like... user-space networking so there's... not really much math like that going on period lol"}

No. I did the internship during the summer then 1900 in the fall. 1 every week but it’s just listening to presentations no i didn't get paid for my research, and i didn't have to pay any tuition charges for my summer enrollment in cs 1950 actually i'm not 100% positive on that; all i know is that i was enrolled in 5 courses (including cs 1950) during the summer 2023 semester and was only charged 4 courses' worth of tuition based on what you're saying i'm *assuming* i wasn't charged for 1950, but can't actually determine with 100% certainty which specific courses i was/wasn't charged for something i only learned recently: tuition charges for summer terms work the same way as tuition charges in fall/spring terms. in other words, if you take fewer than 12 credits in a summer term, you pay by the credit (i.e., part-time tuition), but if you take between 12-18 credits (inclusive) in a summer term you pay the same flat rate (i.e., full-time tuition) regardless of if you're taking 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18 credits and then if you take more than 18 credits in a summer term you have to start paying per-credit again so again, it's possible that what you're saying about CS 1950 not incurring charges is true, but i can't retroactively verify that atp (even without cs 1950 last summer, i still would've been at 12 credits and would thus have paid full-time tuition)"}

(i took dr garrison 12w 1501 and uta-ed for dr farnan 1501 for context) they share projects & slides so content wise I don’t think it differs but dr garrison is more lenient with projects as in he hand grades your code if you ask him and have a legit reason while as dr farnan does not"}

Idk question seems unclear like my homework questions If the language is sufficiently complex, the language can become self hosted. Like how Java is written in Java. Otherwise there are a lot of languages that have a C backend(eg. nim, odin), where C becomes the new bottom layer. If you want to go below C, there's LLVM IR. If the world were to run on a single language, it would either be JS(hell) or C(earth) or LISP(heaven) In this hypothetical are we just assuming machine code and assembly aren't counted as a language We do only have one language. Machine code. Everything else is an abstraction. Even if you chose one “language”, people would build abstractions on top of that as well this is a bit reductive but i think it strikes at the real heart of the question. yes, deep enough down, all hlls become machine code, but machine code is specific to an architecture. and i think thats the real limiting factor here. we will never have one grand unified architecture which all machines implement. partly bc different tasks require different strength and weaknesses that some ISAs excel or flounder at, but also bc once you're dealing with silicon, the buisness pressures become far higher than (generally) open source languages. AMD and intel will never agree to start only building socs under one architecture, and arm isnt gonna just give up its monopoly on IP licensing Is machine code referring to the raw binary as a language? Cause I guess it is If it's assembly there r many types Yeah, as specified by an ISA. So it’s architecture specific I literally just said this Big paragraph I can't read Also I claim u stole this so take that @chris hinson /j Are we allowed to make abstractions of rust or is it just plain rust only rust well at that point I think it'd be better to write it in some form of mathematical notation remove any abstraction from the equation or we can write everything in brainfuck"}

If you're thinking of core ones, which ones do you have remaining? I'm not sure if they're offered but CS 1566 is probably the easiest cs upper level elective out there, especially because there are only projects and no exams its about computer graphics so its also fun There's also CS 1520 which, compared to other CS electives is also probably doable It's programming languages for web applications However, the midterm exam that I had for it in spring 2024 was extremely hard because it required you to master the topics that were covered in lecture 1520/1530 both very doable, 1520 depends a little more on prof love farnan but pass 1520 with paulo is awful. Very easy but a useless class to take you will learn more using like w3schools and reading about the languages. Does not prepare you for actual web design stuff at all But if you just want something easy that looks good on a resume go for it then He’s a nice guy tho just shouldn’t be teaching that class Wish I took it with Farnan but I took it with T James agree that paulo isn't the best choice for 1520, rec farnan if you're actually trying to learn then again if you just want an easy A paulo is your guy Just take Paulo, Farnan is a much better lecturer but he makes 1520 unnecessarily hard from what I've heard, and is a bit of a hardass. Plus, you'd learn more from industry than in college anyways 🤷. I see no reason not to take an easy A."}

I currently work at a CMU lab (big lab). **How difficult is it to apply?** Applying is usually not hard, you just fill out a few boxes and write a few words in response to some questions. On getting into the lab, it depends on the lab, your connections, the professor, the research, your experience, (your passion!). **How to?** I would recommend (in this order): (1) look for a contact form on that lab page (or sometimes application form), and fill that out. (2) reaching out to PhD students that work in the lab that you want to work in, talk to them (set up a quick coffee chat bc cmu is soooo close), see if you *really* want to work in that lab, see if they are looking for undergrads, and then go from there (PhDs will likely know, or know who knows, the channels that undergrads take to get into that lab) (3) reaching out to the professors in that lab but im no expert this is just my experience While this is a very late response, it is nice to hear of other students interested in computer graphics research in particular!

Part of it could be attributed to it being her first semester. But her handout code has broken stuff in them fairly often, and instructions is often unclear. Probably would be better next semester if she has gradescope and stuff setup, and she actually get time to prep for course material. Some of her rmp reviews was probably student being unhapppy that they can't copy paste answers from chatGPT \" She “allegedly”(I didn’t see it but my friend who regularly visited her office hours saw it, and I 100% believe him) literally yelled at a girl till she left bawling at her office hours. I also personally saw her yell at a dude for not knowing anything and it caused him to have a mental breakdown and he left hitting himself in the head violently\" https://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/comments/186e4vk/never_take_barsky_for_cs/ seems exaggerated :peepSociety: is boggle solving really considered a difficult 1501 level project? I didn't personally have it as my project so I cannot speak to it, but if that's your takeaway from that whole thing then wow before I have a \"takeaway\" from the post I try to understand the perspective of the poster, if boggle solving is really a 1501 level project then that would alter my opinion furthermore emotional rant-posts from anonymous people on reddit is not going to be the primary factor in my judgement if a student leaves your office hours in tears you are doing something disgustingly wrong as a professor at least two of her current UTAs whom i trust say that she's a nightmare to work with, also she tries to force the students to use eclipse bc she doesn't know how to use vscode for junit testing (despite the fact that her UTAs have tried to teach her) i'm not currently one of her TAs but i was helping one of her students a few weeks ago and literally half the trouble i had was in just navigating eclipse, with the other half being the buggy pre-supplied code and unclear assignment instructions that @Halcyon mentioned and now its deleted Darn, there goes the primary factor in my judgement fortunately it lives on https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:sjJsSsZ1OeMJ:https://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/comments/186e4vk/never_take_barsky_for_cs/&hl=en&gl=us&client=firefox-b-1-d cant tell how much you're joking so to clarify: I wasn't implying it was earlier just got my ta placement and may or may not be a ta for her lmao, should i back out i didnt know her reviews were that bad so i think i had it as one of my preferences They need you Nij, a generation of CS students are in your hands shittt i wanna switch to 1501 lowk fr  which class would it b for 445 ahh ok I think she's gonna be better next semester since she knows pitt's system better, still wouldn't recommend taing for her tho I can’t speak about her quality as a professor but boggle (should) be trivial for a 1501 student no? I recall Hoffman had us implementing the recursion part of a boggle solver in 445, so it shouldn’t be too crazy for a 1501 student gotchu ill def think abt it lol the issue was it was for a 445 class (in the perspective of the student) It's very close to maze solving actually now that u mention it I think one of my friends is in that class It wasn’t just boggle solving it was generating a board with letter frequency distributions, simulating 6 sided dice, and stuff like that as well- definitely way more than simply implementing recursion in an otherwise complete boggle app Wild how that’s a 445 project ngl the dice thing ended up not happening generating a board with letter frequency distributions is not hard literally a running total and a search Either way it’s too many moving pieces and concepts to be done in a single assignment for a 445 student imo. What do you mean by moving pieces? The parts interact very little It’s just too big of a project to be introducing so many concepts, would have been more practical to introduce them individually maybe. And you can’t really say the parts interact very little when the success of each part literally depends on the previous part functioning, it takes a good amount of debugging intuition and know-how to work on something like that only to some extent, you only need one working boggle constructor to work on the rest of it Not impossible for a 445 student but a large chunk of them won’t and imo shouldn’t necessarily be expected to have that sort of intuition especially when it’s all being thrown at you as a big project I agree it would better as separate labs but the separation of responsibilities is enough to make it work Separate labs definitely would have been better. Alternatively, providing lots of unit tests and debugging support to help verify each component’s functioning would help with the scope of the project and simultaneously break it up into manageable chunks what do you mean by debugging support? I’m taking khattab’s class rn and he provides support videos with common bugs/spots to double check. Another class has very responsive TAs and office hours with FAQs and common issues for the assignment. More of that type of thing would be helpful On the topic of barsky https://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/s/FJRDH53uXD This is insane I was in class for this this is beyond a departmental-level concern, i'd go to the title ix office and it was definitely a joke *fuck I have her next semester* for what? 445 I think it'll be much better next semester the disorganization on the labs is worst part rn and it should be gone rather interestingly this is the same account that deleted their earlier post it's morally, ethically, and probably *legally* wrong to try and manipulate students' OMET responses in any way Given the situation with the class it was in poor taste to make a joke about it. I did not feel like it was manipulative - especially since it's anonymous to the instructor i would argue that if you say youre going to kill yourself if you get bad OMET scores, even if youre joking, its manipulative \" However, she said the death of a good person will be in our hands if we are dishonest or give bad reviews that’ll get her in trouble. She didn’t say it exactly like that but she said, verbatim, “death of a good person will be in your hands” then giggled trying to pass it off as a joke I’m assuming.\" I remember her mentioning it would affect her job at the university but not that, if anyone else was there and remembers it better please post a quote i mean joking or not that's super inappropriate lmao Is that a murder threat I think the intention was “if you give me a bad OMET review I might lose my job and kill myself teehee 🤪” which based off of the Reddit posts and ratemyprof reviews she doesn’t come across as the joking type (so what she did grossly inappropriate and manipulative if this is true) Based off having barsky in class she is the joking type but its usually dry But that implies barsky is a good person Implies that she sees herself as a good person* which is definitely plausible If you say your a good person your probably a bad person What? If you have principles that define your concept of goodness and you act on them then you should think you're a good person what's next \"If you think you're doing the right thing you're probably not\"? howd this get to philisophical discussion it doesn't matter intent matters No, not when it's egregiously inappropriate You simply Cannot Say That as an instructor lol Is Tau secretly barsky??? If I am judging a person's actions then their intent will always matter to me, how the school should respond is another matter entirely I think Barsky's judgement and communication is lacking I'm not defending her saying it, I'm merely saying I understand her motivation :duckblank: and yes it does take a look at intent in criminal law my sister has barsky rn let's say the project she showed me is definitely interesting :O I'm pretty sure threats are treated as serious even if the person claims it was a joke in criminal law, but I'm not a law student so idk not what I meant Ah yes the \"in Minecraft\" defense I'm gonna blow up the earth - in Minecraft I was talking about judging people's action based off their intent and how there is precedence in criminal law There's no circumstance that it's appropriate that a professor said something that implied they're going to commit suicide if their demand is not met in class Doesn't matter if it's meant as a joke Self hardcore world ending is a dumb thing to joke about threatening to do I'll assume you're replying to me, I don't think it is appropriate but the difference in intent will change my **personal** evaluation of Barsky Can you explain what you meant by this? Alright alright come down everyone here is a bunny picture This thread feels like it will get deleted by censorship :duckblank: def wont delete the thread, theres a lot of important info here. lets try and settle down a little tho lol Here's s newer thread my friend found https://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/comments/18bg7bm/marina_barsky_for_cs0445/ But generally, even joking about that stuff is not the play. There are people that can't read sarcasm well or even at all that could've been horrified to hear that when it was said I dunno how they run shit at Oberlin, but it better not be like how I've seen with people in this class yeah i saw that too genuinely crazy how many bad things ppl have to say abt her lol kinda really dont wanna be a ta for her I understand getting a little but this much means there's definitely a problem for sure Especially having a negative connotation surrounding asking for help. I couldn't give a flying fuck if someone walks into 445 knowing everything, the people ask for help are the people that are both not understanding and are interested in knowing. That is not how you treat them. Impressive how hated she's become in less than a semester literally Chances are you'll be alright, but you'll also have to fill in that gaping hole she makes - if you're welcoming of helping students (WHICH SHOULD BE THE BARE MINIMUM) you'll be a patron saint I saw less criticism about Misurda than this yeah im def welcoming of helping students dw haha, im just worried with vague project descriptions + hard prof to work with would make my job a lot more annoying im a TA for ramirez rn and hes really easy to work w Just don't be like a TA I have for a 3 hour lab, they show up for 1 hour are rude to most people, and then leave, so the only other TA has to basically carry the lab for the next 2 hours yeah ramirez was great to work with, I did his 0401 last fall aye same 0401 ill just stick w barsky i think for next sem might be worth asking her current TAs how it's like https://tenor.com/view/batman-gif-4439279616571508647 the students need me I think @Halcyon was saying they are a current ta right? Yeah, TA experience for her depends can she get autograder setup and fix her assignments handout This semester for her -1/10 thanks was definitely feeling better about the new curriculum before the barsky whistleblowing started Gah damn Guess I gotta hope it gets better Should’ve just stuck w 1550 like me 🤓 Damn so I missed a lot by not reading this thread until now ‍️ thread :duckpopcorn: piazza goes crazy for reference the reading \"quizzes\" have unlimited submissions The first 3 messages were fine and that last one was Not Fine I’d definitely make the same mistake as the unknown… yeah not sure what Barsky is on about I'd feel at lot more sympathetic to anon if it wasn't free points I also have this strange feeling anon didn't do the readings “See how fast you will be removed from the course” is wild addressing your professor with “YOU” in all caps is also wild also anonymous to everyone doesn't seem to be an option so... They might be overall right that the student was wrong, but that last statement comes off unprofessional and rude af and mildly sexist I am taing for her u can ask me any questions imo she is not the easiest prof to collaborate with but its fine Incredibly unprofessional final message from her... Yeah, actually crazy she sent that can you share any details about the midterm debacle? Unprofessional from both sides tbh But yea the biggest issue was the last message by far the first 2 are fine then it spirals phew what are recitations like fo rher are u like teaching stuff or is there a exercise? guided excercise got u but she cancelled like all recitations or something right lol no but it did sound that way ohh iirc it was more that she said the ending of recitations wouldn't affect most people because they don't do them gotcha thx 🫡 This is absolutely wild I'm talking to a friend who's a professor at another college in a different department and she's stunned Like this is hilariously inappropriate What did I just read I have no words for it Even a bunny picture can’t save us this time email everyone in 445 a bunny picture I may have to email multiple bunny picture not just one Apparently my sister said there is no curve to the exams they had yesterday :SadgeInTheRain: i mean you only need 20/25 to get a 100% exam grading policy is super generous after all this i cannot imagine 1503 being a sane class considering that theres gonna b much more factors that will make her instructing difficult for TAs too if she cant even have a proper set up for assignments + unorganized slides for 445 imagine preparing and teaching a new course atp how would the TA systems work for 1503? oh joy ? i am a grad student lol wait what is 1503? new ml class they made for students who ~~bitched out of taking OS~~ want a more data science driven curriculum ah yeah i don't quite like that didn't ~~they also bitch out of~~ skip calc 2 tbf the only CS course i've taken that used any calc 2 was 1675, which used some partial derivatives as well as a lot of knowledge from stat 1151 (which has calc 2 as a prereq) *ostensibly* 1503 should now cover that material Also makes sense if they do cover probabilities and statistics since now there is no longer a stat req Pretty good average there was also 2% extra credit (on the entire course) for making a joke or art relevant to data structures, algorithms, or java \"Also I learned a lot from you about human nature, and for this I am grateful:)\""}

Thanks!", "answers": "I think @Jeff took it and he is cracked at figma now I took the class, basically there’s two parts to it. 6 quizzes (online, and you get two attempts ), and then a group project built in dart/flutter (doesn’t have to be a mobile app but must is cross platform), separated into 4 deliverables you present to dr biehl and the ta. Overall pretty cool class, also pretty easy. To add on what anirudh said, i had him for 1635 nearly 2 years ago. His lectures were a bit dry because at times he had a monotone voice. He mainly went over the technical side of frontend development in flutter with sprinkles of ux design. For example, he would go over a touch event and all the processes that would activate in flutter. It was a detailed play by play on how an interface works."}

My remaining classes are CS 0590, an easy science gen ed, and the written professional communication gen ed I'm probably going to take some of the upper level cs electives alongside 1152 in the spring if I take 1151 this upcoming fall I heard that calc is used in the class, how calc heavy is it?", "answers": "extremely tough, heavy workload alongside fast-paced flipped classroom lectures make it a class probably best taken at a different time from that already notoriously difficult combination I took it with professor Nihlani last semester and it was definitely doable but took some time. Similar to a Calc 1 class, weekly homeworks Similarly I'm in 1152 with her again and it's like a calc 2 class I'd imagine taking it with 449 and 1501 would be pretty intense though, your other classes would have to be a lot less work for it to be balanced enough I feel like 1152 is harder, so it might depend more on what you're thinking of taking with that It honestly really depends on how far you are in your academic journey cuz I suffered a lot in that class when I wasn't really ready, but am doing just fine in classes that are much more difficult Then again, I took that class alongside CS1501 + CS1502 sophomore year, and that was a horrendous combination as well took it with bodenschatz, good class. not a ton of work never stressed me out but you do have to keep up with it. it's manageable with those other two so long as your other classes are gen eds. I’m not good with stats and I spent like 7 hours a week on it outside of class, didn’t really like Nihlanis lecture style theres some double integrals and taylor expansion Pretty heavy it's essentially an intro to How Stats Works with proofs, all involving calculus in some way. (partial) derivatives, (double) integrals, infinite sums/products are all used I got along just fine and passed with an A studying a few days before each exam the practice exams Nihlani gives out are probably the most valuable resource for her exams you do really have to go to her lectures though it's offered every semester im pretty sure it says so in the catalog, for 1151 at least i've only ever seen it offered in the fall nvm youre right thank you pitt course catalog I took it with Dr. NIhlani last semester also, i find her lectures pretty engaging, pace can be fast sometimes, but she does posts slides + notes after the chapter is completed there are a lot of weekly hw & gets graded on accuracy, so daily workload can really be time consuming but i thought the exams were pretty easy to prepare for --> allows cheat sheet + provides practice problems, practice exams (and the slides notes). shes also very approachable + easy to ask for help imo i also find her lecture tone pretty calming lol can fall asleep sometimes"}

I’m intuition is that most companies just care about your experience/ projects. Not if you write a nice letter to them i don't think it would hurt, if anything if it's marked as optional and you write one anyway it shows that you're willing to do extra in your application that said, if you *do* write one i would definitely tailor it to the specific company you're applying to, not just submit the exact same cover letter for different positions I think they're usually a waste of time. If it's a position you really want and you have uniquely relevant experience, it might be worth writing one.

{"text": "how to create resume Im just curious which software / programs do you guys use to create your resume? Thanks!", "answers": "FlowCV (simple) Microsoft word (harder, better control) Overleaf LaTeX (hardest, best control) Personally, I ditched my LaTeX resume for a Google Docs .docx resume. The .docx format has gotten me way more responses. I use google doc for mine and just created my own format. I’ve used both LaTeX and flowcv in the past with less of a response rate* (It’s also possible my response rate was biased due to simply having more experience/being done with grad) I don’t see how that would change anything since you’re just submitting a pdf It might totally be a placebo but once I stopped submitting pdf's and started submitting docx, it just feels like I get emails back a lottttt more I wonder if I can run an in-house test on this... Definitely submit resumes in PDF easier to see  That makes no logical sense Perhaps a resume filter or something? ??? defintiely submit in pdf Yeah I have no basis for why it would work, I was unable to submit a .pdf to a site, they required a docx. So, I made a .docx version of my same resume and used that for the next 20 or so applications. This is over a month and a half span and I have had an interview each week (a lot of the time two) which was never the case before I know PDF is definitely more readable to a human but my theory was that maybe docx reads better in ATS? It's actually an interesting debate on Reddit too Maybe \"advise against\" is way too assuming. I'd say try out a docx if you're interested. PDF's definitely do yield results and LaTeX is fun to play with i’ve had the opposite Hmm, interesting could also be content tbh When a site gives you the \"upload a resume\" and then you have to fill in your experience anyway (except it autofills), does everything format in correctly? Usually greenhouse does this to me I always was frustrated when only half would format right but docx has done me right everything except it says one of my projects is an experience which is fine Alright, I'm going to start tracking my applications thoroughly and see if I can get any evidence of this... I'll just interval applications between docx and pdf lmk how it goes im interested might not be the best test because they're literally different companies but owell My guess is formatting definitely plays a role in PDF or DOCX and maybe my LaTeX was just being read weird but I was using one of the top templates so I'm not sure i use jake’s template which is one of the most popular ones this is possible"}

The minute there’s a waitlist for that course at CMU, you’re put on a waitlist waitlist Like @Zhen said, cross registration for niche classes works best I would add that large classes are also a good bet- I took intro to ML (10-301) there last semester and it’s a huge class with 2 sections so I easily got in. Basically try and go for classes that are large so you’re guaranteed to get in, or niche so that it’s unlikely to fill up ik this is very late but im pretty sure you could register for section b for that class next semester as soon as you get your advisor and a dean to sign your form wait how are you able to see the enrollment status of cmu courses?

But projects can be like 20-40+ hours and there’s 5 projects I liked his 1501 so much Im TA’ing for it this fall Farnan all the way Farnan is pretty tough but its definitley worth it 100% to directly address each thing you're asking about here: quality of teaching: farnan **>>** khattab. khattab is a really nice guy but can't teach for jack difficulty: farnan **>>>** khattab. khattab is *v* easy, farnan is p tough ability to contact outside class: my guess is that farnan **>>** khattab. khattab is VERY unresponsive to emails from students in his class, i've heard that farnan used to be the same way but that he's improved in recent years. farnan has been responsive to me whenever i've emailed him about something also, now that we have a questions forum does that mean we no longer have to keep a counter for how many days since the last time someone asked this question? lmao bro you're fine, afaik this is the first time the question has actually appeared in the questions *forum* another thing to take into consideration: khattab is pretty generous with extensions, farnan is *ruthless* about deadlines. at least as of a few years ago if you were even *one minute* late submitting a 30+ hour project, you got a 0 on it in farnan khattab also uses an autograder that lets you see your final score on a project before actually submitting it, whereas farnan only gives you an incomplete battery of basic tests to know if your code is working as intended (i might be confusing him with garrison here -- do they both do this?). he encourages you to write your own additional tests, but determines your final grade on projects using additional tests that he keeps private in short khattab is easier but you learn less, farnan is harder but you learn more Yeah Farnan hides the test cases Like 80% of them Farnan is no doubt one of the toughest CS teacher I had so far. However I want to push a dissenting opinion on the workload. The workload isn't all that bad. Not to dunk on anyone, but I don't think you should be spending 40 hours on the projects. True, most of them were around 20… but both autocomplete and the clustering bitmap thing was definitely 40+ I think some people got autocomplete faster than me but the clustering was hard for most (although I never got TA help, so that would hypothetically speed up the process) I had Khattab for 1501 and I recall he was always available for office hours, yes he hardly responds to emails but it's not like he's totally inaccessible. in retrospect though I hardly remember anything from that class and I had to relearn a bunch myself when i started grinding leetcode since there was hardly any rigor. in the semester i took it he gave out ridiculous amounts of bonus and the exams were very lightly weighted, but i've heard this changed recently I have no knowledge of Khattab but I will say that I really liked Farnan’s teaching style, a very open-ended “ask the audience” approach. I feel that, especially with algorithms and runtime complexity, it really pays off to actively challenge your knowledge. He will usually call on a different student for each step of an algorithm to really make sure the class knows it. Just take Khattab honestly, Farnan is the better lecturer by far, but Khattab is a far nicer professor. I really enjoyed Farnan, what he does is basically equivalent to the tough love style of teaching"}
{"text": "incoming freshman CS 0445 vs 0441 Hi everyone, I am an incoming CS freshman (might switch to data science), and my academic advisor told me I could take either CS 0445 or 0441. I got a 5 on CSA in 11th grade, and I just took college in high school discrete math this past year from Duquesne, but that class doesn’t seem to count as either of these. Do you guys have a suggestion on which one to take? Also I didn’t take any programming classes this year, so do you guys know of any good online review courses to brush up on my programming before the fall? So the rest of my schedule is looking like CMPINF 0001 CMPINF 0010 STAT 1060 CS 0445 or CS 0441 ENGCMP 0200 PITT 0210 (required anti racism, 1 credit) If that influences anything I was thinking that as well so I asked my advisor since I got a 5 junior year, but she said with the 5 she is very confident that I should move on To be honest the teacher was pretty hands off, we did some projects to learn about classes and inheritance and the other topics for the ap test. We just did Java for the whole year. Very minimal sorting algorithms, but we didn’t focus on that too much. Not much other non-coding stuff. Yeah it is all relatively familiar, but I think I would definitely want to do some review this summer to feel comfortable moving on. I would consider myself a hard working student, and I don’t mind studying and working on projects so I am not way too concerned with having major issues in 445 or 441, but I’m not sure which one of those I should take I think that certainly could be a good idea since it is always good to have a strong foundation Like doing both at once? Oh, do you know if 445 is 3 credits? Ohh thank you for clarifying that! I don’t assume 0001 and 0010 are very difficult courses, is that correct? Ok, so I would probably have a good amount out of class to work on 401 and 445 if I do both at once Ohh I was misunderstanding earlier my bad, so if do 401 first semester, what else would I take to get me to the 19 credits? Or your idea is to skip 401 and do 441 and 445 first semester Ahhhh I see Well since I was thinking about 445 or 441 originally, maybe 401 and 441 would be a good idea And 5 of those 18 would be minimal effort Yeah that’s what I was thinking, usually English isn’t the end of the world for me Ohh no worries I am somewhat surprised my discrete class from high school doesn’t count for 441 if 441 is just another discrete class, but maybe I would know some of the content so that would help Ahh thank you! I see now that 441 focuses on applying them to CS where my class didn’t really do that I got into the guaranteed admissions for the information science (I believe) program but I’m not sure if I would pursue that at Pitt. I would probably go straight to industry but higher level could be on the table That is true with getting an early internship, certainly would be nice to put on my resume I am hoping to transfer in calc 1 and 2, macro and micro Econ, and 2 history classes along with some other things so I think I’ll have room early on, so maybe it would be good to do 1501 on the earlier side to be able to do those electives Ok gotcha, thank you both for all of the clarifications and assistance! After thinking about it more I think moving on to 441 or 445 is probably the best idea so i can then go to 1501 in the spring -Set myself up for possible internships and other opportunities -I want to save some geneds for studying abroad, and I think I will be able to clear some of them out with AP credits, so unlocking CS electives by taking 1501 on the earlier side may be helpful So with that being said, will i need to take both 441 and 445 in the end? Or I just pick one of them, and if so any idea on which one to do? I took discrete math this past year, so maybe that would help me with 441? (If i dont need both) Ohh i see both are prereq for 1501 so maybe I should be looking at doing both in the fall", "answers": "Take 445 - DSA It'll be more useful in applying to internships or both together (!) if you are mathematically inclined tbh since you're majoring in CS i'd recommend taking 401 anyway, although only with ramirez (everyone else's 401 would be too easy for you) i mean, if you're saying it'd be too ez for them then they might as well move onto 445 and take garrison for 441 since you already have some discrete math experience, bonidie's 441 would also likely be too easy for you personally i don't think they'd miss out on much to add to this, freshmen very regularly take both 441 and 445 together and it's def doable idk if the DS major requires 441, but if you wanna take higher-level CS classes then you'll def need 441 as a prereq if he can't get ramirez 401 i would agree with going straight to 445, but imo ramirez's 401 would be good for filling in any gaps in his HS knowledge/brushing up on programming in general before moving on to higher-level programming courses e.g. i got a 5 on the ap psychology exam in high school, but since psych is one of my majors i took intro to psych anyway to make sure i had a strong foundation for upper-level psych courses what did your AP CS A class cover? any non-coding, \"pure\" CS stuff? sorting algorithms, analyzing runtime, etc i assume you know about abstract classes, interfaces, static vs non-static, public vs private, all that? i stand by my recommendation to take ramirez's 401 tbh, nadine or hoffman's 401 would definitely be too easy for you but ramirez would make you a better all-around programmer before you move on i tutored some students in ramirez's 401 this past sem and his projects are pretty much 445-level anyway i'd also recommend taking 401/445 *and* 441 if you can, you can take up to 18 credits a semester and the anti-racism course doesn't count against that limit ya yes yeah 445 is 3, 401 is 4 it's usually just intro-level STEM classes that are 4 creds vast majority of pitt classes are 3 creds 0001 is first year seminar, bare exists as a class e.g. if you were to have both 401 and 441 in this lineup, you would technically be at 19 credits, but again pitt 0210 doesn't count against the semesterly credit cap so it'd be *de facto* 18 credits 0010 is almost no work apart from, like, 4 major assignments total yeah 0001 really isn't even a class, and 0010 is just straight-up busywork ya you can't take both 401 and 445, i think you mean 441 and 445 401 is intermediate java, 441 is discrete math, 445 is data structures you could take 401 and 441 first sem, if you wanted or 445 and 441 first sem if you take 401 first sem, you'd be taking 445 second sem since 401 is a prereq if you take 401 + 441 first sem you would be at 19 credits (18 as far as tuition is concerned), if you take 445 + 441 first sem you would be at 18 credits for context, 18 credits is the upper limit that you're normally allowed to take if you had taken AP CS A as an HS *senior* i'd be more amenable to you going straight to 445, but since it's been a year since you've done any programming i still think taking ramirez 401 your first sem would be a good idea correct idk if engcmp 200 would be minimal effort (depends on how well you handle writing essays) but other than that yeah cmpinf 0010 + cs 0001 = 5 credits that are min. effort, i think is what he meant sorry, misread, thought they said 5 of the 6 classes engcmp 0200 is very instructor-dependent, but ya generally speaking it's not a huge time commitment tbh i'm still partial to skipping 401 if possible cuz 1. you already learned the material once and can def catch up if you really wanted to 2. the programming sequence of CS classes (401, 445, 1501) is required knowledge for industry technical interviews, and so putting off finishing this sequence means delaying your prospects when applying to internships this is what shinwoo was referring to by this early msg https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~bill/441 @Gary Farrell do you have any idea of what you want to do after you graduate? e.g. go straight to industry or pursue higher-level studies? if you want to go straight to industry then tianyi + shinwoo's point about taking 445 + 1501 earlier is definitely valid, you could potentially get an SWE internship the summer of your freshman year which would give you a huge leg up actually, i suppose that going straight to 445 would still be good even if you're not going for industry cuz 445 is a prereq for 1501, and almost all CS elective classes are locked behind 1501 so the sooner you take 445 and 1501, the sooner you can take the more interesting CS classes for full disclosure i'm an aspiring academic and have 0 interest in industry, so i wasn't fussed about getting internships or anything like that if you're leaning towards industry then getting 445 and 1501 out of the way as soon as possible may indeed make more sense for you i'd still take *both* a programming course *and* discrete in the fall though, esp. since you already have experience with both it should be fine for you oh and 441 is actually a prereq for 1501, so if you want to take 1501 in the spring you need to take 441 in the fall anyway (445 is also a prereq for 1501) (meaning that if you want to take 1501 in the spring, you need to take *both* 445 and 441 this fall) i would not take a course you do not need to take do not take 401 if you tested out of it there is literally no need to ^ burning time and money, any potential brushing up on 401/APCSA material won't take long just take 445 why anyone would tell you to waste your time with 401 when you got a 5 on CSA is actually completely beyond me correct. this would put you at 18 credits for the fall, which would def be manageable given the other courses in your schedule"}

{"text": "Internship Cycle Doubts Hello! My situation is very similar to https://discord.com/channels/729022532874797146/1262615749441097728, except that I haven't looked at internship offerings yet. However, I have just looked at the Leetcode stuff starting with Week 1. Those questions are marked as \"Easy,\" and while I have the \"Brute Force\" methods down pretty quickly, I realized I was unable to find more efficient methods. I looked at posted solutions and saw that I have no idea what Hash Maps or Hash Sets are, and they seem pretty important to know for this kind of stuff. I did take 445 last fall, but I won't be taking 1501 until this spring, so at the moment I feel pretty underqualified to be applying to anything, especially if these are similar questions to ones I would be asked to solve. Is it worth looking into that Hashing information on my own, teaching myself, and trying to proceed with Leetcode and internship applications, all before next week? Or is this a sign that I should wait for after I take 1501? Some (potentially) helpful info: * I'm pursuing: * CS Major (hoping for 5 year track) * Physics & Quantum Computing Major * Honors Degree * Currently working on a personal project on GitHub: https://github.com/TitanAJ13/Vanilla_Minecraft_Origins_Datapack * Finished a Desmos personal project last year: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/e2wcsaewp9 * Due to my double major, I need 2 capstones, and thus 2 different internship/research opportunities for credit before I graduate * Can't think of anything else at the moment, but I'd be happy to provide more info if necessary Thanks in advance for any and all responses, I really appreciate any advice you have to offer! I've just reviewed my 445 notes and I feel quite dumb now realizing that Hash *Maps* are also called Dictionaries, which I do know about. So uh, there goes that problem haha. I guess I've just never used the built-in hash maps for Java or C# so I wouldn't know the proper syntax for it, but that's pretty easy to research. We definitely didn't do Sets though, I just know what those are from a more mathematical standpoint. So I'll look into hash sets on youtube or neetcode and I guess I'll keep chugging through Leetcode then! I suppose my question can then be rewritten to something like: \"Is the point of Leetcode to do the actual programming and be syntactically correct, or just to have the proper knowledge and thought process to solve the problem at hand?\" I see. So in theory mostly thought process, but make sure to know what the syntax is anyways, especially in the language specified on my resume. Is that about right? About how much time should be given to each problem? 5 minutes? 10? 1? I'm hoping not 1 lol but you can never be sure Oh right, forgot to answer this, sorry. I had Stephen Ellis for 445. That was the 2.5 hour lecture in the evening, once a week. But we did actually go over maps, I just forgot they were called that Much appreciated!", "answers": "Hey don’t worry about it! Not all companies do Leetcode interviews I know that hashmaps are in 445, so unsure what happened there. But definitely learn them! They are super important, I use them all the time Always apply early! Who did you have for 0445? To actually catching up on the materials and learning about hash maps and sets (which are really important for internship interviews, thats like the answer half the time lol) - I would recommend watching Neetcode videos and using his website https://neetcode.io if you are more of a book guy - I would get \"cracking the coding interview\". super famous book but I really enjoy reading my copy as well! if you don't know what hashmaps are, it might be better to watch a few youtube videos, learn what they are, and then jump into leetcode problems. At the end of the day, leetcode is there to help you practice your DSA knowledge, so you'd need a good knowledge base to get started. Hashmaps/sets are super important, and any time you see an array/string related question, theres a good chance that hashmaps/sets are gonna be part of ur solution. I'd reccommend watching a few youtube videos about what they are, how hash algos work, tradeoffs of using them, etc. After that, jump into neetcode It's definitely a little bit of both - fun story is one of my techincal interviews for this past recruting cycle, I requested to do it in Python but my interviewer was like \"haha actually I saw Java on your resume so we will be doing that!\" and then syntax and also problem solving side was checked hashsets are just hashmaps without a value, so instead of a O(1) retrieval for a key/value, its just a value. as for proper syntax, its def a bit of both. for online assessments, since it's autograded with some testcases, your syntax has to be correct. for interviews, i've had some interviews where they say i'm not going to run your code, so it's okay if you get a method name wrong here and there. on the other end, sometimes they come prepared with test cases to run your code against but also were a bit friendly when i had to google a specific method name for leetcode when ur starting out, prioritize throught process, and as you get more experienced, you'll end up not needing to google as much LC can you help you prepare for the technical aspects of interviews and for the most part *it’s really good at that* it can help you become proficient at answering questions in timed manner (like the sats or standardized exams) If you prepare enough in a specific language you’ll become proficient enough where all those language specifications are just second nature Because fundamentally the data structures and concepts are all the same it’s just recognizing the patterns fast enough best practice is to give a question like max 30 minutes locked in then just give up and watch a solution video and understand it (i like to take notes as well) Most OA are like 3-4 questions and you’re given 1-1.5 hours so I’d say 20-30 mins yup do a problem for 30 mins, if you’re stuck for a long time not making progress, look at the solutions understand the solution not just the code, then revisit it a few days later to make sure you understand. then do more problems of that same pattern. Also this is really good advice. From my experience there are patterns that some of these problems use that are not explicitly taught in 445 and 1501, (fast and slow pointers for example) https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards a little outdated but this is a list fo companies that don't do technical interviews"}

{"text": "is my 2-year schedule too insane so I started a psych degree in Aug 2020. was supposed to graduate this semester but decided to add a computer science major instead. this is my plan for finishing both degrees by Dec ‘25, and it would be 15-16 credits per semester. do you guys think this is doable? should I rearrange any of the classes based on workload? couldn’t do this cuz 445 is a co-req with 447 I could swap out 449 for something else (1503? a UL? a gen ed?) if it’s too hard to take w/ 1501 and 1502 “heavy” as in “difficult, I’ll have to work hard” or as in “I’ll hate myself all semester and contemplate dropping out”? word, will consider switching places w/ something easier yeah probs AI/ML, my ideal sitch would be to find a career situation where I can use both my degrees ok gotcha, good idea ohh ok that makes sense!! thank u all for the help :))", "answers": "also doing a double-degree in CS and psych and that looks doable to me, fall 24 looks the hardest with 1501 + 449 + 1502 + a UL elective 447 is technically only a *co*-req for 449; as such, is there any chance you could take both 447 and 449 over the summer, instead of stacking 449 with 1501? @Krit Ravichander any thoughts? krap 449 1501 & 1502 is definitely doable but it's gonna be heavy on work load on your side 1502 is more of a theory class so you won't be getting extra programming assignments 1503 is a new class so probably won't know how bad it is until later this semester I think pushing off either 449 or 1502 until later might be the move (into Spring 2025 or anything afterwards) would help a lot @stacy what sort of UL electives are you interested in? more systems-oriented or e.g. more AI/ML oriented? (i'm assuming the latter based on your psych major) It's challenging, but definitely depends on the person. 1501 is a pretty big jump in difficulty imo People do 449 and 1501 together do find it really hard, so I'd push 1502 to later if ur really worried about it in that case i think the only UL electives that you would need 449 for are 1632 and 1660 i'd probably swap 1503 and 449 in the schedule you drafted above 1503 will presumably become a prereq for AI/ML courses at some point -- it's not clear if that will happen within the timeframe you're envisioning, but it's another potential reason to take 1503 earlier rather than later (also even if 1503 isn't technically a prereq yet, the knowledge *itself* would probably be useful, especially for cs 167x courses) That just means you're supposed to enroll in them together, not that you have to. I took 445 and 447 in different semesters. I think they are both pre-reqs for 449 though."}

I am certainly spending more time doing work for classes than any previous semester here, but I’m not suffering too much. If you have (or can develop) good work habits and tackle the 1501 projects early, I think it’s a reasonable choice A lot of people that I know have struggled w some of these classes (1502 especially) have had attendance issues and missed a lot classes, so if you know yourself to skip classes when you have a lot of work, this kind of schedule could definitely cause you to do that which may become an issue Wait with physics too? And one of Misurda’s sections? you'd be fine dropping 1502, the only thing it's a prereq for is 1510/1511 taking 449/1501/1502 would be doable if you had lighter gen eds on the side, but i wouldn't rec that trio alongside something like physics + lab"}

{"text": "is there uncountable or countably infinite sentences? like to any sentence with an \"yeet\" as the first word, you can add a \"skirt\" right that's what i was thinking map every sentence to a integer, and then you can always add an extra word ooo very good point i think this question is really poorly phrased now that I'm thinking cuz for well-formed sentences or anything is <s,v,o> format, i don't even think it's infinite and yes there's a clear mapping between words and punctuation combinations and the natural numbers, so if we relax the \"well-formed\" or even \"has to make intuitive sense\" you still can't get out of countable also countably infinte permutations of strings but if we allow grumbles and mumbles and guffaws, I think that's where we could get infinite frome but I feel like that's more of restriction on human ability rather than imposed by the logical structure. like if \"I am cold\" is a sentence and \"I am not cold\" is a sentence and \"I am not not cold.\" is a sentence, \"I am not (x inf) cold.\" would obviously never reach the terminal word, but an argument still could be made that it was a sentence since it has both a subject and a verb. yeah ig that's the main question tho can you call a not-well-formed \"sentence\" a sentence \"I am not not\" is not a good example fs but much better example, but still have the issue that it's not terminable if its infinite Either way, the original thing was not whether sentences were infinite but about infinite sentences. Which if you mandate the requirement of termination and the requirement of idk making sense (probably a better word for it) I'm pretty sure the answer is it's not even infinite. But we do have a sort of loose understanding the meaning of \"sentence\" I feel like. in any case, this could be a very valuable discussion for anyone trying to filibuster the galactic senate like if someone were to stand up and make a \"motion of personal discomfort\" and it was already cold, and you knew they were probably going to say they were cold, but this was a senate hearing held outside the constraints of time and they wanted to filibuster it, if you were asked about them after they had already said \"I am\" and were just repeating \"not\", you would still say they were \"struggling to finish their sentence\". I get that's a horrible argument and it may seriously make me worthy of decapitation for saying it but still. ig that brings up an interesting question - can you have uncountably infinite groups of infinite groups? like I can definitely have only 1 group of an infinite thing, and I could add to that group another infinite thing so I think that's enough to say yes to countably infinite groups? but idk how you'd have an uncountably infinite set of countably infinite sets This is so cool…awesome idea", "answers": "If you treat each word in a sentence as an integer, you could probably proof it similar to diagonalization? you can always switch a word out for a different one or the next in a sequence would a sentence needing some kind of punctuation mean that eventually a sentence has to end? so converting words to integers and interpreting it like this So the language is every word + every possible ending punctuation And you'd be able to prune valid sentences from there because \"hello.goodbye.\" isn't a sentence not sure if I'm missing anything, there are roughly 470,000 words in the English language. convert each natural number to base-470000 to get a sentence. most of these \"sentences\" are gibberish, but the valid sentences will be a subset of the natural numbers and thus countable. Idk man infinity is pretty big maybe this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo i'd imagine it could recurse or repeat in some way `any sentence consisting solely of the word \"buffalo\" repeated any number of times is grammatically correct.` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo#Usage does a sentence needing some kind of terminal punctuation mean their length must be finite? yes; by definition \"terminal\" punctuation would imply that the sentence has a terminus is \"i am not not\" a sentence though? bc even disregarding any terminal punctuation, if you try to embed the infinity mid-sentence like that then \"i am not (x inf)\" is technically the only form you would actually be able to achieve wyt of this? I think the main driver of the size of the set of all sentences is going to be (linguistically) recursive sentences “This can be understood in terms of a recursive definition of a syntactic category, such as a sentence. A sentence can have a structure in which what follows the verb is another sentence: Dorothy thinks witches are dangerous, in which the sentence witches are dangerous occurs in the larger one. So a sentence can be defined recursively (very roughly) as something with a structure that includes a noun phrase, a verb, and optionally another sentence. This is really just a special case of the mathematical definition of recursion.” (From wikipedia) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion This can go on forever - “John thinks that sally said that Mike told Evan that Sarah said that….” {{x*i| i in Z} | x in R} maybe? I don’t see why you couldn’t have an uncountable infinite set of infinite sets- For example, imagine a set containing all integers AND 1 irrational number. Now, construct every such set. You would have a set of cardinality 2^aleph0, (same cardinality as set of all real numbers), with each item in that set being an infinite set But with regards to the question of how many possible sentences could be constructed, I think that it comes down to the cardinality of recursive sentences. I imagine it is possible to enumerate all sentences by simply alphabetizing- so, in that case, a 1:1 mapping would exist to the set of natural numbers and the cardinality would be aleph0"}
{"text": "Is this schedule suicide? (Need advice for upper-level CS electives) I've been in a tough situation this semester. I have all my requirements for both my minor and major satisfied, I just need two more semesters worth of credits to graduate. I want to make sure I get the opportunity to take a lot of CS classes before I leave here, though I don't want to overwhelm myself of course. Knowing that, I want to take 1555 and 1520 (w/ farnan) mainly, as I'm most interested in those and heard they're not easy. I also found one non-cs gen ed that I want to take that won't be too hard. That leaves me with two more \"gen ed spots\". Here's what I'm thinking: - 1555 (Heard it's a challenge, not too crazy though, considering one of my \"core\" classes for the sem) - 1520 (w/ farnan, heard its a challenge and involved, considering my second \"core\" class for the sem) - 1660 (I've heard this class is dirt easy but can still be somewhat useful, considering this like 1/3 gen eds for the semester, just happens to be cs related) - 1699 (w/ tan, functional programming, heard its an intro class to haskell, similar if not easier to 401 difficulty, considering my 2/3 gen ed for the sem) - My last non-cs 3/3 gen ed (should be fairly easy) Essentially I'm breaking this up into my \"core\" classes that I think will be difficult, followed by two less stressful \"gen eds\" that are still CS related so I won't be bored in them. If I take another gen ed I'm just going to look for something super easy that I won't care about, so I figure it's better to at least pick something CS related. Is this a good idea or is this going to be semester suicide? Intro to Cloud Computing I've got a friend in the class who said they're 9 weeks in and the most intensive work they've had was uncommenting a project they were given the solution to From what I've heard it's extremely easy (though this is all only word of mouth of course), but it still has some useful information I've heard SQA will most likely be more work than 1699 or 1660 I plan to take it though, probably next semester For this semester I'm just trying to pick two work heavy classes (1555 and 1520) then two relatively less stress classes Yeah again I'll probably do SQA next sem since I've heard 1660 (for sure) and 1699 (most likely) will be less work or as little work as it Unless you think it would be a better pick than something like 1699 (but I also love tan so i may be biased lol) Guess I may be sticking with it then I'm planning to take computer vision and SQA next sem Not sure what else yet Though to point out my original question, do you think this semester will be unreasonably hard? Or with the classes I'm picking should this be more tame than I anticipate? It's just the label of 4 CS electives making me a bit apprehensive. Cloud computing definitely will be, I'm a bit less confident on 1699 Has anyone taken 1699 w/ tan and SQA and has insight as to which is less work / less difficult? I'd only be doing one of the two alongside the rest of my semester but if 1699 is overall less work i'll go with that one I think", "answers": "What's 1660? Take SQA with wunsun ahn Heard it's ez and informative I’m in SQA rn, isn’t much work tbh. Maybe an hour and a half tops per week in terms of workload But it’s two people groups so it kind of depends on your partner From what I heard functional programming is typically only offered in spring If ur planning to graduate in two semesters I’d say take it this semester I put in a laughable amount of work for sqa, it was a very easy class. if functional and cloud are considered easier than that then you'll be fine @zach 1699 with tan is really fun and a decent bit of work. Nothing crazy. Doing that alongside SQA is fine. SQA is more volume than 1699. You also have a partner in SQA, so it should be not bad if you have a good partner. Really depends on how comfortable you get with Haskell. SQA probably has easier content but more content, so SQA is overall more work imo. 1699 is what I would choose. Way more fun yeah it is p easy atm, it's dan's first semester teaching so he's still getting his bearings"}
{"text": "Job Offer What Would You Do I was recently given a job offer and need to give them a decision by Friday 11/15. I’m grateful that I got it but there are a few things that I don’t love about it 1. I don’t really like the location. I think I would feel a little bit lonely and bored 2. The salary is fairly low. It’s not like super low but it’s probably the lowest I’d be willing to accept (I think around 70k-80k would be a reasonable expected salary for first job and the offer is lower than that range) 3. The job is sort of poorly defined. Like it’s just “software engineer” as the title, but from what I’ve gathered the job scope is not very well defined. Like they have someone doing scientific algorithms while also doing blog posts which makes me a bit worried that they will have strange expectations of the work I’d do 4. It’s a really small company (less than 15 people) and they seem to expect me to stay for a few years, but there doesn’t seem like a lot of room for growth My biggest fear is that I won’t get another offer by the time I graduate in the spring. I’m just sort of very conflicted rn and any thoughts or insights would be appreciated! It’s pretty cheap afaik. I just think it’ll be a pretty boring suburban area to live in. I’ll def ask them more about what I’ll be doing Salary is like one strike of what I feel like is 4-5 ish strikes. Like if it was just the mid salary that was bad it would be alright. I’d also feel pretty bad reneging on them since it’s a family company and so small. Like if it was a big company I would do that fs Thanks for all the feedback. It seems like they’ll be a little flexible with the salary and after a few months I’d be able to do hybrid if I want. Still going to be looking for more and maybe pulling out but who knows", "answers": "You can definitely ask more questions about what you'll be doing. Is it a high cost of living area? If salary is a big deal-breaker you can always try to negotiate. This may be controversial, but in today's job market, I think reneging on an offer if you find something better is definitely an option. Obviously, it kinda burns a bridge, but at least you have something guaranteed if you don't find something else. Yeah that definitely makes sense, maybe express some of your concerns/look at some potential activities or groups in the area to see if anything interests you? I know people who have backed out at the last second ( like 2 months before the start date ). So, you could accept and still keep trying ( obviously not moral but life is life lol ) +1 this, it leaves bad blood to pull out after you've accepted and its generally a bad practice but **technically** there is nothing stopping you Congrats on the offer either way!"}
{"text": "Just how difficult is Farnan’s 1501 section? Ight so I know there is another question on the forum that discusses if you should take Farnan or Khattab’s 1501 section (or rather recommendations) but I kinda wanted to ask about Farnan’s section more in depth: I am a commuter student, and it seems like Khattab’s section is later in the day and kind of astray from the rest of my classes, and I have also heard his lectures and depth aren’t nearly as good as Farnan’s as a general sentiment. I obviously want to learn as much as possible and it seems like Farnan’s section could be just that, but it also seems… quite demanding. I was just curious *how* difficult Farnan’s 1501 section is? I’m aware it’s going to be brutal, but if someone could give me a rundown of what to expect/how to prepare for taking it here in the upcoming spring, that’d be amazing. Thank you! Appreciate the response! I also saw he hides test cases. Does he give a tester file still, or does he just kinda expect you to build the program totally from the ground up? I was curious (especially since you are a TA, so you could give some good insight) how you deal with not having full test cases and any tips for that? I also tend to write code really slow and honestly I used to have a habit of not drawing about problems until 445. Appreciate it! Another thing I wanted to ask is how were the exams?

I highly recommend Dr. Farnan’s 1501 if you wanna understand DSA Heavy emphasis on the project times, I took it last sem and the projects took the biggest chunk of time out of any of my commitments, school or otherwise. If you're gonna take the class w Farnan i'd recommend blocking out a good 8-10hrs per week minimum for the projects alone and absolutely start them early. Lecture was always great tho, as Daley said if you want to actually get DSA he's an easy pick Exams were fine honestly, the projects required you to be so thorough with implementing the concepts that you just became proficient with the concepts before you even had to study. I only really \"studied\" a few concepts i would say the exam are nothing special. if you understand the lecture, you are good, and can replicate the procedures on the slides you be fine.

If you've taken 441 and 1502 you should be good, but the best thing to do is always email the professor. 413 isn't identical to 441 (the latter half of 413 is an intro to real analysis) but 1180 won't use any real analysis. pretty sure the point of the 413 req is to make sure that you actually know how to do proofs if you're comfortable with proofwriting then 1180 shouldn't be bad at all, provided that your prof isn't shit i believe @Deleted User transferred from 280 into 1180 without having taken 413 so she might be able to give her thoughts you'd be emailing the math dept undergrad director and/or the prof of the 1180 section that you wanna get into (for that last point, the math dept instructor schedule still hasn't been finalized yet, so who knows who the profs will be) (common math dept L) 441 feels like enough for 1180 imo!

{"text": "Master's Theory and Algs Classes Anyone that has done on of the masters theory and algs courses (CS2150, 2110, 2012 and 2011)- do you have any recs on which one to take or who to take it with yinzers are literally the greatest ppl ever and im naming my firstborn rubber duckie after you both", "answers": "2011: never heard of it 2012: this is just the cross-listed grad section of 1510, algorithm design. you learn about greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and parallel algorithms, and the course focuses on developing algorithms for various types of problems and expects you to *prove* that your algorithms are both correct and optimal. 2110: this is just the cross-listed grad section of 1511, theory of computation. you can think of it as a more advanced version of 1502: computability, complexity classes, turing machines, reducibility, etc. 2150: this is \"grad algorithms\", which you can treat as the sequel to 2012. as for recs, it depends on your goals and interests. if you ever plan on taking 2150 tho, i'd recommend taking 2012 first since 2150 will cover more advanced algorithm topics. as for whom to take it with, they're all taught by the same prof, kirk pruhs, so this question is irrelevant. i have taken 1510, 2110, and 2150 like tianyi said i have also never heard of 2011, but from some quick googling looks like it mightve been an old version of 1510 cross listed? but probably irrelevant as for dr. pruhs, its an accquired taste for sure im fucking terrible at everything he is passionate about and teaches, but he has consistently been one of my favorite professors at pitt but i also know some people hate him irregardless so i dont really have any class specific notes to add on top of what tianyi said except for some recent stuff about CS2150 so i took it this spring. the spring before this spring was the last time it was offered, and according to pruhs it was the worst course he has ever taught in his life so he made some changes to it this spring that may or may not stick around until next year first and foremost, his policy for almost all courses has always been if you show up, actively participate, turn in homeworks and make an honest effort, you'll get a B and pass. then if you show some additional knowledge above that, youll get an A but he said that people started to abuse this and show a complete and terrible lack of any algs knowledge, especially for what he considers a phd level course so instead, he gave two exams, a B exam, which was meant to test the absolute memorization basics - literally just repeat analyses he did in class and then if you scored well on that, there was to be an A exam a week later that you could be invited to and gave you a shot at getting an A he then made all the weekly problem sets optional here is how that turned out so. not great. i would maybe steer clear of that until its offered again and pruhs has a chance to rethink how he wants to run the class unless you consider yourself a pretty good algs and theory student, in which case you may be fine i got a B-, which would be a failing grade if i was a phd student, but since i am an MS student, it was just barely passing for me as an elective credit (i also completed and received at least 2/3 credit for all hw sets with my group, so i had to have failed the fuck out of that exam) the only student i know of who got an A was stephen arndt, because he is actually beyond cracked at this field and afaik not a single phd student passed so take that as you will, and feel free to ping me with any additional questions or concerns"}
{"text": "Math 1070/1101 Anyone taken these classes tryna give some insight into difficulty/ time commitment/ profs. Trenchea for 1070 and wheeler or hung hsu for 1101 ? O hn Might just move to spring cuz 9 am and to try to get hung hsu But also saw he taught only section this spring lmao Ok so class content not that difficult Disorganized makes it hard Is his actual lecturing good tho to learn or did u have to self study hella Ok thanks Writing own textbook is crazy Might ask u for that exam sometime", "answers": "Dr Wheeler is crazy He drinks in class, kind of unorganized, and ppl love or hate him I took 1101 this last spring with Wheeler and thought the class was interesting and useful. I dont think the class was too difficult in terms of concepts discussed but the main difficulty came from how the class was ran. Wheeler was very disorganized and would not give the clearest instructions a lot of the time and expected the highest quality work with every edge case taken into account when solving a problem. My biggest advice for the class would be to always pay attention and dont miss class. He hated when people would skip/miss and would rant to the class about it . In terms of time commitment I usually spent anywhere from 5-10 hours a week on assignments/studying but this can vary depending on how much you understand the content. You are given 5 hw sets from the text book(which he wrote and are filled with errors) and are given one week to turn them in in class at the start. The hw was not too difficult but finding resources on how to solve some problems or getting help can be hard because there was only 1 TA so I would suggest doing it with someone/ a group. The exams were probably the most annoying part of the class not because of difficulty but because the the amount of work you are expected to output with the time you are given. All the exams are open note with access to the internet but even then that wont help too much if you dont understand the concepts. For my class and the class before mine there was supposed to be a course project but that was cancelled due to time constraints so it could be the same case for the next class and be prepared to take the one and only mid-term 2 weeks before the final he also ended up curving the mid-term by 31 points and reused the previous term's mid term questions despite all this I still think wheeler was a decent lecturer it just took some time for me to adjust to his teaching style does he actually drink in class Since he wrote the text book for the class, he teaches directly from it and so doesnt have any lecture notes like other math profs this can be both good and bad. Its good because since he wrote the text book so you know what type of questions are asked on the exams and hw sets and can prepare accordingly but also your only resource is the text book which has limited problems and answers(almost none). He explains things in details for the most part but will go fast with some of the proofs and examples in class. I would suggest making your own notes while in lecture and copy all the problems done in class and pay attention because it will be hard to self study due to the lack of outside resources/problems to practice. What made the class easier for me to understand is having taken a discrete structures/proof writing course before hand just to understand some terminology and taking CS 1501 DSA2 along side it because a good 30-40% of the course is graph based(network flow, shortest path, min cut/max flow). There are also no practice resources besides HW/book problems that dont have answers and the hw is graded on accuracy and presentation just to add. I was also able to get a previous exam to study off from a friend which was also helped greatly and was probably the single greatest resource I had in that class(it was basically the same as my exam just slightly different). The professor may also not teach every class, there were a few instances where the TA taught the class(once or twice) because wheeler was busy with something else, if Edison is the TA for the class you should be good tho he understands the material well and can explain it better than wheeler. I personally didnt do much self studying because I tried not to miss class and would go to the TA office hours regularly Sure, but I can’t guarantee that it’ll be the same questions as what you might see on your exam but it will definitely cover the same topics."}
{"text": "MATH 1101 Professor My two options are Wheeler and Constantine. I've heard mostly negative things about both of them, but was leaning towards Wheeler. Any input? wait his section is at 9am lmao i think this answers my question... choice between two bad options noon! yea ive never taken a class earlier than 11 im not changing that in my senior year oh youre fucking kidding me 1060 and 1101 have a conflict theyre both fall-only reqs for the DS major who designed this fucking curriculum im on the verge of dropping the entire DS major instead of taking constantine for 1101 in theory yeah but it's horribly designed for some reason the data science major seems like it was hastily thrown together so pitt could grab onto an industry trend i have no idea why it would seem like that 1101 optimization 1060 data science foundations \"This course is a general introduction to the rapidly growing field of data science. The topics covered include descriptive statistics, probability, sampling, hypothesis testing, and ANOVA. Broader topics such as regression analysis, model selection, model diagnostics, etc. will also be discussed if time permits. The course will be very hands-on with students actively carrying out the techniques/procedures to foster the ability to reason with data. As part of this process, students will learn the basics of programming in R, and these skills will be reinforced through weekly labs. In developing the core concepts, students will also be exposed to ancillary topics such as data ethics, simulation, and best practices in programming. No previous coding experience nor background in statistics will be assumed.\" it's weird because they also require STAT 1261 which is \"Principles of Data Science\" and has almost the same class description @🅱 o n k (tianyi zheng) yeah and they're both fall-only the data science major has a shitload of fall-only classes for some reason i knew the data science major was a disaster but i didnt think it would be this bad stat 1060 is apparently redundant with stat 1261 but theyre both required and 1060 is 4 credits so it's blocking me from fitting my major capstone on top of fucking with the 1101 bottleneck thats crazy bruh they couldve just not made this class sooo wheeler vs constantine... take home exams are appealing i guess? sounds like every other element of both of them sucks so it's 9ams and take-home exams vs noon and 50 minute exams in both cases the professor hates you awesome me when its actually too late to switch to a stats major it was too late to do that a year ago too i was surprised by how much of a disaster it was to double major in CS and stats honestly i mightve just been misled bc im on my 5th advisor now and my main takeaway so far is that my previous 4 were wrong about a lot every time i get a new advisor they spend our first meeting marveling over how much incorrect stuff the previous one told me i have emily park rn and she seems good at least but it's a little late now yeah i could not fit that shit i took 1151 instead of 1000 for the cs major and the stat minor required 1000 like ok man ive spent so many hours wandering around thackeray believe me ive tried like every avenue it's too late now unfortunately for anything besides CS + DS yea i'd prefer DS but it's definitely an uglier market tbh i wanna see what i can do without a masters maybe ill end up with a phd eventually but a masters sounds like a nightmare maybe i can get accepted to a brand new shiny data science masters program that costs $220k over two years", "answers": "@🅱 o n k (tianyi zheng) feel like ud know also heard bad things about both but i've never taken the class or had either prof for constantine, what i've heard is that he's not a good lecturer and can deviate lot of the syllabus when it comes to course content, and also that exams and hw are brutal for wheeler, what i've heard is that he's extremely disorganized and goes on tangents a lot, meaning that you might have an exam coming up while being extremely behind in lecture and wheeler's exams also suck, from what i've heard prepare for wheeler to be pissed and extremely disappointed when the class bombs an exam are there any like even good math professors here? i feel like ive always heard everyone is either mid or ass lol wheeler's classes are often also at 9 or 9:30, is it diff this time? you gotta go w wheeler wow common pitt math dept L real there are, but they're few in the dept and most people will never have them ahh ok the pitt math dept just sucks, imo i have ellen/shiting bao for linear (granted ik thats a very intro course) and shes pretty good bro gotta tke the 9 am now i really, really liked thomas gilton for a *super* niche math elective, but he only really teaches calc (presumably cuz the dept makes him) or lin alg or said niche elective common DS major L, unfortunately what elective is it? prob a fair trade is the DS major any good im not taking it but im planning on doing 1656 next sem so kinda curious avg pitt 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 math 1410, intro to the foundations of mathematics, it's about the development of math as a logical model up to gödel's first incompleteness theorem that sounds awesome was it hard i didn't find it that hard as a class cuz gilton was super chill about running the class, but ngl i def didn't/still don't fully understand the material haha nice yeah it was a lot to take in and some parts of the class were def kinda rushed, imo gotcha he apparently teaches 1180 (lin alg) sometimes so i'd prob recommend him for that i recall the curriculum having classes that didn't exist yet when it first came out, has that been fixed? thats the more advanced lin alg right what's 1060? i assume 1101 is optimization yeah it's the math major lin alg class ah gotchu so prob harder than 0280 what does 1060 cover? that course name def doesn't help my understanding is that 1180 covers more material and at a faster pace, but it's not *that* much worse (tho note that i didn't take either myself) @Deleted User started in 280 but switched to 1180, so she can prob explain it better than i can hello hm \"harder\"... idk if i would say that. it is just a bit different 280 was straight computation, id compare it to calculus and 1180 is proof based so id compare that to discrete ahh gotchu, yeah im in 0280 rn and it is just computation after computation lol bruh  nij i'm sorry but that sounds mindnumbing lowk is 1180 is easier imo tho because it feels less time consuming nothing is more fun than row reduction for an entire class as long as you can think proofs avg lecture tbh id imagine the stats department may have something to do with that lol but 1180 exams are not proof based yeah i believe 1180 is currently covering vector spaces? nah we did that last week ah ok have y'all gotten to eigenvalues/eigenvectors yet? no not yet this thread has just become math-general unless we did it today, i missed class cause i slept in norms? lol ~~i hardly call linear algebra math~~ one of my unbased opinions theres numbers so its gotta be math!! it just doesnt feel like real math yk wait til you take grad-level lin alg then it's *really* math  yeah i was gonna say maybe i need to take a grad level version (or rather it's just abstract algebra) that sounds hella scary ugh please, im scarred from abs algebra and i havent even taken it it's all vector spaces (and maybe tensors) tbh abstract algebra really isn't that bad (until it is, and then it's really bad) yk seth is grading his colleges version for it rn i literally cant escape the rings have you ever taken combinatorics? in the math dept? no i wish i took it, i feel like i wouldve been good at it i heard constantine and wheeler teach it, hence why i never took it LOL and now we've gone full circle to the start of this thread :ipkSip: apparently DS majors need to take > CS 1656 - INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE > STAT 1261 - PRINCIPLES OF DATA SCIENCE > STAT 1060 - DATA SCIENCE FOUNDATIONS pitt either needs to get better at naming, or stop wasting DS major's time. anyway what are you planning for your schedule then? 1060 is similar to 1000 i believe 3 different ways to say the same thing lol data sci is too ill-defined a term isnt 1656 more similar to stat 1361 no i've heard it's mostly just sql and python so it's diff from the other two ah you're thinking of 1675 still, the ds major at pitt... it seems like a hasty decision and not well put together if you really wanna get into data science be a statistics major like me!!! definitely not advertising I took wheeler for 1101 and between the two choices if I could redo it I’d go with Constantine tbh I had friends in Constantine’s class and it seemed dramatically easier than wheelers class especially if you’re already familiar with some of the concepts such as graphs Wheelers class is hard in a bad way like he makes he trace algorithms by hand and there’s 0 actual algorithm writing you just trace them so if you want to manually keep track of dijkstras and tsp stacks, which a computer takers care of, wheeler makes you do it by hand which is stupid imo On average we’d spend about 12 hours for the homework in that class btw i dont like that... I took Constantine for 1101 and would not recommend it. I still don't know what optimization is. His lectures are straight from his book but if you don't understand there's like no other way to think about it. I went to his office hours once and he was like if you had two brain cells in my class you'll do well. The only plus is after the first exam, the rest are take home but I spent like 6 hours on the take home. Wheeler straight up called us stupid in class as well and our exams were in class in 50 mins yup > and he was like if you had two brain cells in my class you'll do well. nah thats insane LOL that makes misurda seem like a nice guy Also a friend of mine who had wheeler for graph theory apparently straight up walked out of class when a student started presenting his term project and when he was done he was like “oh sorry you didn’t attend my lectures so I thought I’d do the same to you” but that’s not 1101 bro Math dept moment its not too late to switch to a stats major its never too late!!! a lot of people do that double major tho like me i hate it but i like the majors somehow i still feel as if i dont see people in cs going in ds i hate the extra reqs let alone ds majors whaaat thats a lot personally, i'd prob recommend a math minor + stats minor over the data sci major whats an advisor i only know https://pittcswiki.netlify.app/courses/ isn't she an SCI general advisor? ig she advises data sci now too? thats still a lot of credits stats minor is only applied too whats the point of being a stats minor and never having taken probability!!! blashphemy. ugh maybe you could get them to still cross of the req? take more than the min reqs for the minor just take more stats classes in general tbh cuz the relevant classes are split across multiple depts ive had them count classes for gen eds before true take game theory very relevant!! /s and i assume you want to go into ds and not swe which is why youre trying to take stats/math classes very true if you plan on getting your masters i dont really think it'll matter having the ds major since cs is relevant enough but bachelors ds market rn is very brutal :ipkCry: well data science is new the buzz word so hopefully there'll be lots of new intern/new grad positions for undergrads (for the online degree /s) (the in-person data science masters costs double) pitt's new masters program doesn't even have an application required definitely not a cash crop SCI degree mill arc? /s Yea like Constantine is bad but if you just need it to get the DS major and don't care might as well bite the bullet lol. Like I finished with an A-, so its not like you'll fail but you'll hate every second of your life in that class No application? How do you enroll? Do they just send out acceptances to random people? you have to do some online exam no technical bg required no gre no app"}

But if you could get quizzed on trivia then just read docs 100% peep the docs in my experience every subsquent language is easier to learn if it's a really technical/hardware job I would look up a crash course on memory management, data management, syscalls or w/e"}

{"text": "OMSCS @ Georgia Tech Hey! This may be a little bit out of scope for a pitt cs discord but I was wondering what everyone thought of the OMSCS program with GT? I got accepted today and was considering doing it part-time as I work with Sheetz. I’ll be doing less SWE work and more so project management (essentially being the SCRUM master on a couple teams to start) but I’d like to remain very technical. My dream positions are in leadership/management but I’d like to be some sort of an expert in the tech side. Becoming a Software Architect has been one of my dream job titles for a while now and I feel like a CS masters would push me in that direction? I have been sort of all over the place so I’m genuinely curious what does everyone think of a program like this? that’d be great I’m 90% sure I’d want to do it very part time, atleast starting with 1 class in the fall then doing maybe 1-2 per sem, not sure how summer sems work I’d like to keep working though I love school and classes but I like them in moderation How many classes do you do a sem? Definitely starting with 1 ty I didn't know about the need to petition for more that's interesting I'm also worried they messed up applications being they said decisions will be going out next week and everyone on the sub seems to be posting about getting in lol That checks out Your profile says GT '23? Did you already finish the program? In two years? Ahh gotcha Did you do 1 or 2 classes in those summer sems? Yeah I don't wanna do it too quick I just don't want to be in it for too long Gotcha That sounds reasonable I really like the idea of doing only 1 or 2 courses at a time because then I can genuinely enjoy them versus just trying to get As in all 5 of my classes very useful thanks! Do you think that the first semester will be a good gauge of how much time it'll take up? Fair enough gotcha Well thank you, this is very helpful! I might dm or @ you in the future... this site seems so useful https://www.omscentral.com why doesn't pitt have this @steelhacks someone make this let me correct myself someone add this to pitt cs wiki I just like the search/filtering ik the wiki has reviews tho This would be more useful for all gen-eds tho I like it so far! AI is fun Did, - HCI (joyner is sick but a lot of busy work), - AI (actually engaging lectures even tho they’re remote) - Game AI (I would have benefited more to have taken a unity class beforehand) I think I’ll be doing either NLP or knowledge based ai this summer and hopefully ML in fall Yeah I don’t really go out with my friends much anymore which does suck but I’m still finding a balance I'd definitely do a course listed as 10-20 hours if you want a feel for the program HCI wasn't the best intro for me but I'm glad I stuck to it Also remember those reviews do have bias similar to rate my professor", "answers": "@rohit ganguly? I have a friend who is in it rn. He went to a different University but I can ask him how it is so far pretty sure he did the program while working at msft Whoops my bad @🅱 o n k (tianyi zheng) def doable part time, most ppl do it like that one of my friends is full time at vanguard and is doing it no problem also hate to ping more ppl lol but @Alex Zharichenko is also doing it part time rn yeah I did haha The program's tough, especially with a full-time job, but you seem motivated enough good resources to get started: omscentral.com for course reviews omscs.gatech.edu for course list/specializations (you gotta pick one) reddit.com/r/omscs for questions Anywhere from 1 to 3, I'd advise starting out with 1. Your initial cap is 2/sem but you need to get a B or higher in 4 courses before you can petition to enroll in 3 (don't advise this, I burnt out suuuper hard during that sem and withdrew a class about 50% through anyways) Some classes are easier than others, you can use omscentral reviews to determine if you have enough time for doubling up The quality of education is high but like any school, you get what you put in It's hard to stay motivated and I thought about dropping it and being a normal early 20s kid many times lol Again, really don't advise that hahah based on first hand experience They're generally very lax with admission if you have an undergrad CS degree Don't worry about getting in, the hard part is getting out The program has a very high dropout rate since it's tough and part time Yup I got out last fall finally living life normally 🤩 well, technically 2.5 ! - fall 2021 - spring, summer, fall 2022 - spring, summer, fall 2023 I could've done it quicker, but I didn't wanna die 1 class, for summers always just do 1 class it's a delicate balance of enjoying life and progressing course breakdown was: - fall 21: 1 class - spring 22: 2 classes - summer 22: 1 class - fall 22: 3>2 classes after dropping one - spring 23: 2 classes - summer 23: 1 class - fall 23: 1 class ofc! keep in mind, general life + working will take up a lot of time, and dealing with deadlines will be stressful IMO it's a great program still and worth it if you can stomach the slower weekends and stress spikes Depends on the class you're taking, hence the advice to rely on online reviews Can't tell you for sure some sems will be tough, some won't @rohit ganguly what are some of the classes you took/what classes would you recommend for the program? just curious would you happen to know the admission rates? Wikipedia says 74% Tbh I’m contemplating graduating w/ a CS minor and doing OMSCS instead of doing the CS major at Pitt Would be same number of classes to finish and much cheaper lol might have more electives than the pitt cs dept too lmao pitt cs wiki solos 100 emoji, we just need to add more detail and filtering to course reviews and we're golden (and mark which prof) uhhh the HCI class was great, ML for trading was good, AI was hard but good, video game design, game AI i didn't go too crazy on the heavy technical classes bc my undergrad covered a lot of it Ironically enough I applied for this as well I’m just waiting for the response @Kavin Sankar some prior discussion on OMSCS here Thanks! Be the change you want to see in the world @rohit ganguly I'm reviving this thread. I am going to be working full time and applied to OMSCS for the fall (guessing I'll get in). Would you say that getting the degree has been worthwhile career wise or was work experience more valuable? Also do you have any things you wish you knew before you started? Do you feel like you had free time or was most of your time dedicated to work and OMSCS classes? Thanks. I’m doing it rn and let’s say I do not have much free time but that’s also due to me working a lot of overtime from work I spend about 15-20ish hours give or take for one class if it helps Ok thanks. Are the classes enjoyable to take just watching videos and doing assignments? I'm also starting in the fall! Thanks for the responses. I'll probably do one class in the fall then if I hate it/too busy/too stressed to do it I'll probably just not continue, but it seems like a pretty good program This cannot actually be 50 hrs worth of work right that's insane \"So in conclusion, if you are reading these reviews, I just want you to know that if you are thinking \"oh this class might be interesting or fun\" then just don't take it. If you are thinking \"I have all the time in the world and really enjoy just being driven to the brink of sanity\" then absolutely take this class.\" This is the class I want to take the most LMAO thx for reviving this thread, i was also waiting to hear back from this program Not enjoyable as much there’s a lot of busy work I had to drop this semester due to work pressure I will go back to it once I have time whenever work pressure is down I heard from my classmates that some classes feel like full time job…"}

The worst part was when Hoffman was giving 0007 students 401 work and other questionable decisions and had to deal with some administrative stuff as a result. But generally for the appointments themselves, the student needs a little bit of guidance while the concepts for you should be quite solicited at this point so you don’t really need to think too hard. A little bit of white boarding and being able to put yourself in their shoes is enough in my experience. I did 7,401,445 last semester pretty similar experience. Guiding people through debugging is very useful for 445. Not exactly sure how it is now, but the time commitment was very flexible. It's pretty chill overall. for 449 you need to be ready to read and debug a whole bunch of C code. Cause ppl will come to you and say \"I'm not sure why this is not working\". Peer tutoring is pretty flexible with timings cause you can choose how many people per hour you want to tutor. Your main job is going to be to visualise and explain what's going on within the assignment."}

The way I think of it is think about climbing a ladder. 1. Prove that you can climb up the first rung (base case) 2. Prove that you can climb up the next rung for any rung (inductive case) 3. Since you have proven you can climb the first rung and any arbitrary sequential rung, you have proven you can climb any rung of the ladder So for a function 1. Prove it’s true for f(1) 2. Prove it’s true for f(n + 1) 3. You have proved it for all n The link seems to have a few easy to understand practical examples https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs103/cs103.1164/handouts/240%20Guide%20to%20Induction.pdf the difficult part about induction (after you understand the definition is) when and how to use it, which linked article (although a bit dense) does a good job of explaining most induction proofs are kinda mechanical, where you are just substituting in values and things just work out TM. both are equivalent as in the reasoning steps are pretty much the same. Strong induction can have slightly diff base cases. But the distinction is simply \"If you're using f(n/2), f(n-1) in inductive case, make sure they're also true in base case\" https://brilliant.org/wiki/strong-induction/ I took garrison's cs 441 and he got a pretty good explanation of strong induction. Get the base case first, and the for Induction Hypothesis, assume that (I will use k=0 for base case) P(0) ∧ P(1) ∧ P(2) ∧...∧P(k) is true for arbitrary nonnegative integer k, then show that P(k+1) is also true in inductive steps.

(nice survey [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-022-02598-9)) This is cool and is probably a provably most efficient way to do it since there is a limited number of pieces. but at the end of the day it is a computer program to do what us humans (present company possibly excluded) do for fun. then ofc theres the slew of ppl who made an ai solver out of it, but idk throwing labeled data at a ml pipeline is just so boring and 2012. thus, i want to think of new ways. unfortunately im bad at math and do not know anything at all in the world. does anyone know about this stuff? could you solve a puzzle as a reverse packing problem - aka minimize the space around each piece? could you solve a puzzle evolutionarily, attempting to fit each piece together, measuring the strength of the \"next generation\" as the unfilled space between the pieces as well as the color similarity between the edge pixels? could puzzle pieces have sex? could you solve a puzzle by social media, i.e. a weighted graph selection problem? do we think twitter (formerly x) was actually created by the aliens to get us to solve their captchas for them is the answer to all life a puzzle? absolutely brilliant no notes also the astrology from when the piece was created, a few generic responses to some prompts, and the height, width, and weight of the piece", "answers": "yes! Idk if this helps but tetris has been proven to be NP-Complete which means hole filling can be difficult. https://erikdemaine.org/papers/Tetris_COCOON2003/paper.pdf While an evolutionary system where you treat combined puzzle pieces as creatures and make them mate to create the perfect creature, aka the solved puzzle, sounds interesting, I am more interested in puzzle piece love triangles (and other polygons). The theory is that each puzzle piece has 2-4 soul mates and they need to find them in a large population. We solve this problem like we do in the real world. Using social media. We use a multi modal llm and input the puzzle piece image and output a chatbot. The n chatbots created are given accounts in a social media/dating platform like insta and the chatbots learn relationship dynamics to figure out who their soul mates are (in finite time ofc). Once every puzzle piece has found their soul mates, the puzzle is solved. would this then assume that puzzle piece shape equates to a personality for the chat bot that matches/attracts that of its puzzle partners puzzle piece shape and pixels of the image, yes. If this feels infeasible, then you're just not believing enough (aka not throwing enough gpus) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09246 An unsupervised pretraining task idea was to create jigsaw puzzles of images and solve the puzzle. It does square puzzle pieces. You could make irregular shapes maybe and do the same training. This would probably not scale well to very large puzzle. I think they do like 9 puzzle pieces on 256x256 images"}

{"text": "questions about the election i'm curious about the election as an outside observer: 1. i noticed that there are a bunch of new positions on the ballot, what's the motivation behind adding these and how does this change the role of the existing officer positions? 2. why have a meeting attendance requirement for voter eligibility? and why 4 meetings? i can't recall exactly what the reqs were last year but i believe this is a new change 3. why have the election in person? is it for logistical reasons? tbh this is pretty normal for csc elections, incumbents winning a lot of the positions, in part cuz of unopposed campaigns and a general lack of competition", "answers": "+ not taking public questions hi @Officers @Former Officers! i'm actually pretty curious about this election as well! specifically, my concerns revolve around the fact that , based on the github history, the constitution was amended 3 weeks ago (on 3/25/25) to add the event attendance requirement to vote. i have a number of questions and concerns about this change! 1. i'm concerned about the timing of when this was added to the constitution; adding eligibility requirements to vote (under!) three weeks before the election seems very strange. why was this change made? who proposed the change and when was it proposed? On what grounds was it approved? 2. why was this change in voting eligibility not announced before literally today, the day of the election, at 1:14pm, which is obviously well after anyone would have had a chance to attend events to gain eligibility? 3. how did you arrive at 4 being the number of required events? by my count before today's events, there were only 4 or 5 events that could have counted towards eligibility after the constitution was amended (assuming the change in the constitution was even noticed by anyone!) i'm posting my count of the events after my questions 4. was this change properly reported to SORC as required by the amendments section of the constitution? ``` panther talks 3/26 internship event 3/31 formal 4/5 (does this count as an event for these purposes?) vibe coding 4/7 wics panel 4/10 duolingo visit 4/14 (does this count as an event too? it had limitations on the number of attendees i believe, right?) uxd collab 4/14 ***(TODAY RIGHT BEFORE VOTING)*** ``` https://github.com/pittcsc/Documents/commit/019964093d5760840c8eda9fc325a51684290910 it also appears that the majority of people who were elected tonight were already officers as well: ``` 4/2024 elected officers President - Nij Patel @Nij Patel Vice President - Julian Alamo-Rosas @Julian Alamo-Rosas Business Manager - Quentin Romero Lauro @Quentin Romero Lauro Director of Initiatives - Morgan Engel @Morgan Engel Events Coordinator - Shreyash Ranjan @Shreyash Ranjan Communications and Media Manager - Kathryn Bager @kathryn bager Sponsorship Coordinator - Insiah Kizilbash @Insiah Kizilbash ``` ``` 12/2024 elected officers @Haiden Hunter @Liam Brem @Gabby Flynn ``` ``` 4/2025 elected officers President: @Shreyash Ranjan Vice President: @Brayden Nguyen Business Manager: @Haiden Hunter Events Coordinator: @Liam Brem Partnerships Coordinator: @Insiah Kizilbash Director of Outreach: @Morgan Engel Director of Technology: @Quentin Romero Lauro Director of Design: @Delaney Scheidell Creative Media Officer: @Jeremy Luu ``` President,VP,Partnerships,Design,Media were unopposed btw Some more build up to the election would have been nice, the time between candidate announcements and the election was very short i mean, i know that specifically is not super uncommon for clubs, but the change in voting eligibility with no announcement prior to the day of the election, combined with there only being like 5-7 events even possible to attend between the (unannounced!) constitutional change to eligibility and the election is... also concerning Hi everyone! Thanks so much for your questions /concerns :). Please know the former team and the new team are working on a thorough response to address these concerns Yeah the way it happened doesn’t feel good and transparent, I wish this was clearer from the start. The way it was executed now feels sort of hush hush because of the said lack of transparency. Was that the intention? idk, incumbent CSC officers are well known enough to win elections and changing voter eligibility probably wouldn’t change much. My take is that if you want to vote in a campus student organization election, you should probably have some level of campus student organization involvement, though I'm still curious why 4 was the number chosen. CSC is nowhere near the first club that has this requirement. If you’re not involved in an on campus student organization and want to vote in the election for it, I’d wonder what the intention is. For example, let’s imagine I joined the discord and tuned into chats here and there without going to meetings. Let’s assume I’m the top 1% of online-only CSC participants and work on projects with others, chat with people about CS, go to virtual events, and make a few friends. In this scenario I’d be excluded from participating in the election because my participation was virtual. Despite my extensive participation, I in this scenario still have no idea what in person club members want or who most members are, how to improve club events, processes, and importantly, haven’t prioritized the time to attend the organization in person. Would I still want to participate in an election for an org I don’t really know, especially when most of the experience I’ve had virtually was self driven and independent from CSC campus operations anyways? So my issue with the attendence requirement is not the fact that it exists; it's not particularly unreasonable in a vacuum. The issue I have is that it was implemented without any announcement three weeks before the election (which wouldn't have given people the ability to attend enough meetings in time), and only announced the day of the election(!) > Despite my extensive participation, I in this scenario still have no idea what in person club members want or who most members are, how to improve club events, processes, and importantly, haven’t prioritized the time to attend the organization in person. Well the in-person members are also virtual, given how little effort it takes to join discord and it's use as form of communication, I assume that almost all in-person members are in the discord. There are processes for online participation that there are major issues with. Events yeah, but low event attendance can also be due to lack of interest in said events and schedule conflicts for evening classes. > Would I still want to participate in an election for an org I don’t really know, especially when most of the experience I’ve had virtually was self driven and independent from CSC campus operations anyways? Better to have a choice than not, if they're that uninterested in the elections they can just not go. Hi all, thanks for your questions. I’ll do my best to answer them here: First, we’ve renamed particular officer roles to better reflect the state of the club and the role’s requirements. 1. \"Director of Initiatives\" is now the \"Director of Outreach\" to better reflect the role's focus on communication. 2. \"Director of Sponsorship\" is now the \"Director of Partnerships,\" highlighting the role's broader responsibility in managing relationships beyond sponsorships, including product partnerships and advertisements. Given our growth and to address organizational needs, we've also created two new officer positions: 1. **Director of Technology:** Many members have expressed a desire to expand our focus beyond career services and into technology-oriented initiatives. While we will continue successful programs like Zero2Offer, we also plan to incorporate more technical projects. This role will support student-led tech initiatives, assist our consulting team, and enhance CSC’s overall technical direction, aligning closely with our identity as the Computer Science Club. 2. **Creative Media Officer**: Previously managed as an initiative lead role, the importance of our social media presence has become clear. Growing our Instagram from approximately 400 followers to over 13,300 has been a significant achievement, requiring considerable effort in partnerships, collaboration with content creators, and managing platforms like YouTube/TikTok/Instagram, as well as editing + ideation and so much more. Elevating this role to a full officer position underscores our commitment to maintaining a strong, impactful online presence. If you have any additional questions about officer roles, please feel free to ask! Next, on our voting requirement changes: Last year, active members faced challenges with the ExperiencePitt system, sometimes failing to appear as members, leading to confusion about voting procedures. Holding elections in person allows us to provide immediate assistance for any issues voters run into. We increased our prior requirement of zero meetings to four to ensure voters genuinely understand CSC’s activities. While we’re thankful for participation of any kind from members, voting in club elections requires a deeper understanding of the club's activities and objectives. To determine the requirement of four meetings, we looked across all of our major event categories: General Body Meetings (GBMs) Tech Events (SteelHacks, workshops, academic and research-focused sessions, etc.) Career-Oriented Events (Zero2Offer, internship talks, site visits, etc.) Social Events (formal gatherings, fireside chats, BitByte sessions, etc.) Attending election speeches, meeting the candidates, and experiencing CSC firsthand ensures voters are educated about the organization and its leadership. It means voters are involved and interested in CSC events and making them better. This requirement is especially common among the larger organizations on campus. The addition of eligibility criteria was **not sudden**, though we acknowledge it could have been communicated better. The first internal mention was during winter break, and we reached a resolution during spring break. Regarding who proposed it and when, any constitutional change requires a majority board vote. This vote occurred two days before the GitHub update and passed unanimously among all voting board members. SORC was also informed of these constitution changes in accordance with our and their rules. There were multiple announcements made to this change during in-person meetings - such as the \"Crushing Your Internship\" talk, the Board Interest Meeting, and in this morning's newsletter. We also sent out an email to all eligible voters on April 13 at 1:54 PM which stated their eligibility and encouraged them to vote. **The officer team believes attending four meetings is both reasonable and achievable.** CSC has hosted over 65 meetings this year across all of our events, meaning that interested voters only need to attend ~5% of the events we’ve held. CSC typically holds at least two meetings per week, often more. **Additionally, these events are held across multiple days of the week to ensure those with conflicts can participate.** To reiterate, with such a diverse set of events and opportunities to participate, the officer team feels attending four meetings as a requirement to vote is reasonable. This year, we saw over 180 members attending at least four events and being eligible to vote. We acknowledge that these changes came much later in the semester than we would have liked, and we acknowledge a lack of outwards transparency in the process which has caused some rightful criticism. We’re thankful for your feedback and will incorporate it into future election processes as we continue to work hard to improve CSC. Also our email is PittCSC@gmail.com, by sharing your thoughts/comments/concerns/feedback here - this allows the officer team to show our advisors and get various perspectives. With situations like this, I want to remind everyone of our server’s rules, specifically rule 5: \"If you have any problems or feedback regarding CSC policies or individuals, please send us an email at pittcsc@gmail.com (from your Pitt email). **Do not post it in the general channel. This is to avoid public arguments and create a more welcoming community for all members.** Officers are happy to meet over Zoom or in person to discuss concerns or ways to improve the community.\" prez Fwiw I do not think that this is actually an appropriate policy. I think that, if nothing else, having a space dedicated to meta discussion in the server is appropriate. Trying to get public feedback without public discussion is not very effective in my experience thanks for this response, glad to see it's a communication thing this note is taken, and will be brought up at our next officer meeting - thank you! ^, I get not wanting it in general but in a thread, forum post, or dedicated channel what's the harm? i don’t know how other officers feel about this so we’ll have to talk at officer meeting but i would be in support of a thread channel like this one for topic based discussions if that’s something people are interested in. I agree that some sort of contained feedback discussion place could be a good alternative. I would hope there's a strict code of conduct on giving feedback, though. From experience, it really sucks to get passive aggressive anon discord hate especially when you put so much effort and care into things. I'd imagine that's why the rules came up as they are today also not implying that any of this has been that, just saying why I think these rules existed in the first place Those are both extremely reasonable points. A code of conduct surrounding feedback is incredibly appropriate. And yeah, I have been on the other end of the discord hate stuff too, and it really sucks. So I'm pretty sure that some of the reason I end up coming off as aggro and hostile as (I'm sure) I do is like, a mix of the culture of the Internet spaces I grew up in combined with like... The fact that, as a woman, there's no really good way to provide feedback/opinions a lot of the time. Like, as a woman, at least at my age and in tech (and academia too tbh), it is almost impossible to find the balance between like... Not getting ignored or talked over (if you're *too* passive) and not being seen as being a bitch (if you're too assertive). So, at least in text-only contexts, I bias towards assertiveness, as it's the best way to be heard. All of that's to say that like, this stuff (and honestly all of the discussion I do here in this discord!) isn't intended to be personal attacks at all. It just sometimes can come across as that due to like... The tone and posture that come with how I've found the most effective way to be assertive in places like this is Totally get it, thanks for clarifying I hear you - balancing being heard and misjudged as a woman in tech is tough, especially with internet culture’s influence. Text can amplify assertiveness, and I appreciate you saying it’s not meant as personal attacks. A feedback code could help. Thanks for sharing. just wanna say thanks for the questions all and I apologize for any lack of communication w/ the election. i'm glad we were able to clear it all up, and while i can confirm the election process went smooth last night -- there's def some points of improvement for next time around so everyone's on the same page"}

I took 447 with Jarret, and then 449/1550 with Misurda, and plan to finish out the systems load with Adv Sys SW w/ Luis next semester :). To me, it seems that Misurda -> Luis -> Jarrret in terms of handholdiness least -> most. Jarret definitely gives a lot of project guidelines, while Misurda expects you to play around a bit more and understand the what's and whys (admittedly haven't had Luis yet but have heard nothing but RAVE reviews). It's really all about what you want out of 447/449. Misurda loves his lecture tangents, and you may not get too far into the syllabus but what he doesn't get in breadth he definitely makes up for in depth. If you want a bit of a lighter semester while still hitting all the same points, I'd recommend Jarret (and I'd probably plop Luis in the middle but I can't speak to that first hand). I LOVED Misurda, and I now TA for his 449 sections, so that's my personal rec ;). I don't think you can really go wrong with 447/449 tho, all the profs are fantastic, know their shit, and want to see you succeed. take jarrett for any class you can imo Farnan and jarrett What’s that mean, I’m in his 449 https://discord.com/channels/729022532874797146/1166987668467486750 When in doubt always take misurda what a fire review"}

{"text": "running red lights ok so. the principle problem of an intersection is a left turn is that there is a singular resource (the center of the intersection) and two people can't share it at the same time. But if they could. Theoretically, you could invent some sort of shape that could pass seamlessly past another, at an agreed upon angle. I'll leave the specifics out of this, as just assuming it was possible is sufficient. But now, you've essentially reduced the problem of a 4-way stop to that of scheduling, which makes it, ofc, a misurda-wet-dream-os-scheduling-problem. Which leads to the central question here - could you arrange an os in such a way that it could run two instructions exactly concurrently. I mean, by the time you set it up, it would essentially be a double-core processor, but a single program, with one CPU reading the instructions exactly as planned, and the second CPU reading them in reverse. I can't yet see why it wouldn't work. I also can't really see how it would be useful, except that with a lot of work, you might be able to build an os or at least a program that appeared to do one thing on the \"normal\" os, and did some other exploit on the \"mirror os\". a lot of work for a tiny little prank. But it is a little bit worrying, since any double-taped turing machine is reducable to a single tape. So. Could you mix instructions? if you gave the scheduler a bit more memory, could you build a program that selectively stored the \"state\" of a register at a certain time in another program, or stored the bits lost in a bit shift, or the like? Is your os still your os if it runs its own programs? However you go on that, it does bring an interesting problem up in the realm of entropy. The way I understand it - Shannon entropy at least - is that it is the information gained, i.e. p(observed) - p(expected). *i know thats not the math j work with me here*. So, if you expect a program to do something, and it does nothing, has it entropy? *org post continued* in a debugging sense it doesn't matter, but in this psuedo-instruction sense it does. Like a CPU reading an instruction and doing it means everything that is off is off. So, a message could be encoded by recording - say for example the carry bit of the ALU - when a program was run, provided you had access. I'm not actually thinking to do this - since that would just again be making a single tape TM a dual tape TM, but still the fact that there is an information gain by a TM doing a thing is worriesome to me. Doesn't that pose some issue for the halting problem?", "answers": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_long_instruction_word (?)

{"text": "should I transfer to sci yet? I’m in Dietrich and 99% sure I wanna major in CS. The only thing is, tuition goes up once I officially switch. So I want to know, is there anything I’m actually missing out on by camping out in Dietrich for now? The only downsides I could think of are having an academic advisor from the wrong school and maybe not being able to be a TA/peer tutor, but I may just not know about all the things I’m missing.", "answers": "You don’t get reserved seats which can affect getting professors or classes you want If you say you’re considering a double degree and stay in Dietrich as well as get into SCI they avg out the two schools tuition. Nothing to stop you from dropping Dietrich the semester before you leave. wait this is so smart wtf Everything about this tells me I should double major and drop one. I’ve had the thought since last semester only caveat: you have to transfer to SCI in your last 30 credits for the residency requirement but I am in a similar situation to you and I save on average I save about $2000 per semester Wdym by residency requirement? Like in state vs oos? Residency Requirement All students must earn a minimum of 30 new credits in residency at the School of Computing and Information, including at least 15 credits within the major program. At least half of the major program credits must be earned at the University of Pittsburgh. https://www.sci.pitt.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions#:~:text=All%20students%20must%20earn%20a,at%20the%20University%20of%20Pittsburgh. Correct. But I don’t think that should be an issue. If you are in both schools you can still earn the 30 credits while in both. Maybe I’m wrong though. If so, they missed it with me. I graduated this past December and didn’t leave the CBA until the summer. The main thing is you have to drop before the final semester so you can apply for graduation. i dual-enrolled into SCI from dietrich and was able to meet my SCI residency requirement while dual-enrolled np the way my tuition charges worked was that one semester i would be charged dietrich tuition, the next semester i would be charged SCI tuition, and so on (i.e., it would alternate on a semester-by-semester basis) so you could very well wait until your last year to transfer into SCI to avoid being charged SCI tuition (as long as you plan on completing 30 credits, at least 15 of which contribute to the CS major, in your last year) also you can still be a TA/peer tutor w/o being an SCI student there are several dietrich-based math majors who are only minoring in CS but are CS utas/tutors in short: if you're sure that you'll be able to take 10 classes (30 credits) total in your last year, and that at least 5 of them (15 credits) will be part of the CS major, you have a financial incentive *not* to transfer *in principle* the caveat about reserved seats that jonah mentioned applies, but there are generally enough unreserved seats for undergrad CS courses that it shouldn't have any actual impact (then again, i get priority enrollment through the honors college so i've never had any enrollment issues -- it's *possible* that if you're not in the honors college *or* SCI you might run into an enrollment issue here or there, but probably only in rare scenarios like when there's only one non-barsky option for 445)"}

{"text": "Specializations/interests in undergrad? I graduate with my second bachelor's in a year and I'm still pretty indifferent to literally all the coursework I've done (besides crypto cuz I'm currently getting cooked in it lol this sucks). Do yinz think it's important to really grind away at one specific thing throughout undergrad or is breadth over depth the way til figuring out your niche? Obviously it's good to have stuff to put on a resume/cv but I just haven't found that spark of joy or inspiration yet and I'm worried about kneecapping myself by being jack_of_all_trades#17261735281813 once I start hunting for employment. Currently taking applied crypto with khattab over the summer, yeah And yeah sorry for not making it out to many meetings last year haha, I wanted to come to the zero to offer talks but I work closing shifts 🥲 TBD but I'll definitely try to shift my schedule to make attendance properly Is there an easy way to find when/where those are? I didn't even know there were office hours for the club aruifbrahjkgbkajrhg", "answers": "You had coursework in crypto? Did you do an internship? In today’s job market, being a generalist can actually help you get your foot in the door, especially early on when you're still exploring. (*come to our zero to offer talks to learn more in Sept. *) It gives you more shots on goal and keeps your options open. That said, figuring out what you actually want to specialize in long term is tough. Some people gravitate toward areas like backend, cybersecurity, or AI/ML and find they enjoy those, while others realize they can't stand frontend or certain other domains. The only real way to figure that out is by doing internships or projects where you can try things out in practice. Coursework can be dry or disconnected from what the real work feels like - at least in my experience So the TL;DR is you don’t have to go all in on one thing yet. Start broad, see what fw, and once you find something that clicks (or at least doesn’t suck), you can go deeper. Whether you want to become world-class in one niche or stay versatile is a personal call. Both paths can work depending on your goals. @Juniper Ferlan Talking to @Brayden Nguyen abt this is also a good idea if you have further questions Also, for anyone else reading this thread: it's really easy to get caught up thinking about the future. But that’s the future. Focus on what you can actually do right now -- today or tomorrow. The rest will fall into place. Don’t stress oh cryptography lol Are you working those shifts again this sem? Our meetings are typically M/Th - 8-9 I completely agree. Especially for new grad roles they don’t really expect you to be experts anyways and you could more easily develop these specialized skills on the job. It is also easier to move to a different role within a company than trying to get hired at a different company with the role you want. Also a good amount of the class works and personal projects aren’t too reflective of industry work because of the scale It’s better to cast a wide net for new grad and then have the rest of your career spent finding and developing specialization If you ever can't make a meeting, come to the CSC office hours or message us and we will be happy to meet and see how we can be of any help I make an annoucement each time they're held- this year it'll prob be during the weekday for a multi-hour time block But I'd prioritize coming to meetings, since they've consistently proven effective and are the most efficient use of everyone's time. Office hours are great for one-on-one advice and help Coinbase must be scrambling the terminology Idk how applicable this is to CS, and I’m only speaking based on what I’ve heard my engineer friends say. But I feel like the degree doesn’t necessarily prepare you for specific careers(like they don’t teach meches how to build cars), but they teach you how to solve problems, and then your workplace/internships are expected to teach you the practical skills of your profession. Or at least force you to pick things up as you go. When I did my SWE internship, I picked up some useful stuff for that like using specific libraries, structuring and deploying scalable code, etc. and now for MLE, I’m also picking up some certain tricks to that trade Lol yes"}

At this point we have: 1) 1503 Mathematical foundations of Machine Learning - Barsky 2) 1571 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Singh 3) 1671 Human Language Technologies - Li 4) 1675 Introduction to Machine Learning - Skeba 5) 1678 Introduction to Deep Learning - Kovashka My experience with 1541 was very good, there wasn't a lot of programming, it was largely about the concepts involved. It was fun and mildly challenging without bogging me down with huge assignments I'm also curious about other opinions on 1652 how do I edit titles I decided on deep learning because the professor comes highly recommended from multiple sources and I am a glutton for pain my next semester is going to be so busy cryptos not even that hard", "answers": "i am taking CV with kovashka right now and its awesome. i recommend her as a professor which AI/ML class is the most beginner friendly? I'm looking for info on: 1) 1541 Intro to computer architecture - Ahn 2) 1652 Data communication and computer networks - Shangguan there's a question thread on 1652 i think somewhere here https://discord.com/channels/729022532874797146/1160938360278372424 good callout sry yeah should have linked Looking for info from anyone who took functional with Tan It’s a good class I didn’t take it that’s just what everyone says  is anyone taking data bases rn? 1555 hmmm i was assuming there'd be an option for that I really liked it. For me it wasnt an * easy A*, definitely took a little bit of work but Tan writes in Haskell more than any other language so he is very knowledgeable on the subject Really fun class and haskell is interesting so definitely recommend. Wasn't super hard, but it can be if you don't get adjusted to the Haskell syntax. Also some proofs, but only for a week (and the midterm). The proofs themselves are not that bad do you know how to get the permission # to get into the course? i went on sci's permission # request form and 1699 wasnt there last time i checekd It is there now @Nij Patel oh ok, thanks Changed the channel name: Spring 2024 Upper Electives @todd I took 1520 with farnan, and as you said , I found it to be pretty involved. most of the projects were a lottt of work (and there was 4 of them throughout the semster). the tests werent too bad since they were take home, but they did test on things that we didnt do projects (ie we had rust on our test but we didnt use rust in our projs) I took it alongside 449 so it was a pretty challenging semester but i did manage to do pretty well in both classes, so i think you should be alr taking it w 1555 assuming the rest of ur schedule isnt too bad Yea to add onto Nij here I took Farnan 1520 with 1555 (and also 1550) and survived. It’s a tough combination but I wouldn’t be off-put to it if that makes sense, it’s def doable yeah im a bit concerned with it, ive heard SQA is good to take, so im considering doing 1555 and SQA, then 1520 with farnan + another less challenging elective next sem (like computer vision or cloud computing) think that'd be a better play? Seems like a good idea. I did SQA, 1520, and func prog along with some IS upper level electives which was definitely manageable. What you proposed as a possible schedule seems totally doable this is potentially my second to last semester and ive only gotten to take one upper level elective so far, so im considering trying to cram a bunch in instead of taking useless gen eds i dont need but i also dont wanna kill myself with work lol well thank u for the advice! btw farnan does 1520 only in the spring oh :farno: I was thinking of doing this sem: - 1555 (databases) - 1632 (sqa) next sem: - 1520 (programming for web apps) - 1674 (computer vision) - 1660 (cloud computing) I guess i could just flip these semesters, i don't think doing three upper level courses will be too bad since they're both considered easier electives i dont see 1674 on the course catalogue, i guess its not offered this sem? if 1660 is dan mahoney again then that is pretty easy too (so far) yeah kovashka teaching deep-learning :pain: same time frame as the current class, would make sense if he did it again I'll ask him next class well its on the catalogue, so i assume its not changing you underestimate Pitt's ability to screw over students oh is he listed? yea oh yeah then you are chilling if you take that class I thought you posted the small screenshot because professor was TBA I am rn with Panos. I'd recommend it, it's definitely good stuff to know and Panos is a great teacher and super friendly. The work is all reasonable and worthwhile. which ones did u end up enrolling in? Bro says his a glutton for more pain even tho he doing cryptography w/Garrison and honors Lin Alg i don't remember u saying that in the beginning of the term, but then again i got fish memory i've heard 1571 is p easy 1675 and 1678 are both p challenging, haven't taken 1671 so i can't speak to it CV is p challenging btw at least w/ kovashka"}

{"text": "Spring Scheduling Help Spent a long time reviewing requirements and the notes me and my advisor made. From that I've determined: * 1501 and 1503 are must-takes this semester * Either a Physics lecture or a lab is a must-take this semester * If I take a CS Upper elective this semester, I only need one gen-ed each semester for the rest of my time at Pitt Talking to peers, professors, etc, I've determined: * I want to save Phys lab for fall 25 so it can lead into research with faculty * I would like to be a UTA for both CS (paid) and Physics (credits -> Honors Degree) * Could lead to networking and/or opportunities in either department With these (and class timings/overlaps) in consideration, PeopleSoft has only 2 possible schedules fitting all of that, and this is the better of the two. I've also included the time requirements for my choir, attending the Physics class I could TA for, and a possible CS recitation I could hold that fits with everything else. However, it is quite daunting, especially considering my office hours (3 for CS, 3 for Phys) are not included in the mix. I have a feeling I can't do everything that I want/need to, and I may need help deciding what thing(s) to get rid of so my brain doesn't disintegrate next semester. Any and all suggestions, comments, questions, and discussions are welcome. I don't know what I don't know, and yinz are all awesome with this stuff. Thank you very much in advance! Correct, as a Physics UTA, instead of holding a recitation like we do for CS, I have to attend the lecture itself. But the 3 office hours is still the same. But it would still be 5 classes plus choir, cuz of that sneaky web-based gen-ed at the top corner. Oh ok, I've never had either so it was more just trying to fit it in haha, but I'll look into that! Ooh that's a good call, I hadn't thought of that Yea it's pretty small up there. But its ENGCMP 400 with Kent Kosack, who has a good RMP score for making it a chill class I mean, I don't know how much I _care_ about web dev compared to other things, but I do find it interesting. And I have decent experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript already so in theory I wouldn't have to worry as much about those parts? Granted, all my \"experience\" is stuff I've taught myself over the last like 4-5 years so not sure how valid it would be to a real class Alright then! Also, it may be important to note that Paulo's is currently listed as Web based as well ah ok that's too bad Surprisingly it does fit in the schedule though! This is what it would look like with Paulo for 1520 instead of Farnan. Ignore the black gaps lol, I couldn't be bothered to remake all the fake HTML class events again Oh shoot you're right, I didn't notice there were only 19 seats, and for the online one they're all reserved seats :(", "answers": "> attending the Physics class I could TA for does that mean you wouldn't actually be *taking* one of the physics classes you have on that schedule? if so you'd only be taking 4 classes (+ choir) which i think is doable, if you want to make it lighter switching from farnan 1520 -> paulo 1520 would probably be the most obvious choice also keep in mind that at least for being a CS uta, you can hold some weekend office hours either remotely or at hillman (at least as of last academic year you could) oooo i didn't notice the gen ed at the top yeah it's probably still doable then, depending on how much you care about web dev it might just strengthen the case for you to switch into paulo's 1520 (if you don't really care about web dev and just need to knock out a UL elective go for paulo, if you actually *want* to learn web dev that complicates the situation. you could probably pull off staying in farnan 1520 but you'd probably have to be really on top of your game next semester) in that case paulo's class will be an absolute breeze for you, whereas farnan's should be manageable your call, but my guess is that paulo's 1520 will fill up before farnan's; something to keep in mind if you're considering taking paulo html is html, css is css, JS is JS. it's all applicable yeah he's having some medical problems so he has to teach remotely, but the class meets synchronously ya that'd work fine imo slight tangent but i was wondering if you knew if 1520 with Farnan would be a similar difficulty as his 1501? I do kinda wanna take 1520 with farnan cuz he's a great lecturer but i already need to take a few hard classes in spring farnan 1520 isn't as intense as farnan 1501 tbh, i think you pretty much have no chance landing that online ENGCMP0400. Those online classes are usually tiny and get full instantly. how intense is it, if you're able to measure it somehow? I'm likely gonna take lin alg, 1550, and Drugs and Behavior next spring only 4 courses total then? you'll be fine they're reserved for CGS students so you might still be able to get in once the reservations lift. CGS students are non-degree students so they don't need to take gen eds, they only take courses that actually interest them No i just didnt mention the 5th"}

Thank you!!!", "answers": "Although it was perhaps one of the most difficult/involved classes I have taken for my DS major, I cannot say I regretted the experience. Dr. Mentch (if the class is still taught by him) makes sure that you never forget many of the core concepts behind the theoretical side of machine learning, which sets you up well for research or grad studies in ML (this is coming from someone who is currently doing undergrad research in ML). As a result of this expectation, the grading was quite strict - expect to put in a great deal of work on every aspect of the class (homeworks, quizzes, final project, etc. with homeworks being particularly long especially if you are not familiar with R). Quite possibly the most difficult, yet most rewarding, A that I have ever earned in a class - it trivialized classes such as CS 1675 that I ended up taking later.

{"text": "Summer 2026 Internships for Cybersecurity / Network Analyst Hey guys its starting to come around where summer internship applications are opening up for next summer and I wanted to come here for some quick advice and tips from alumni and some stidents who have already been down this path. I want to look for some sort of cybersecurity / network / IT internship for next summer to cover my capstone but right now I am having a problem finding these internships, I feel that 98% of them are just SWE, OR aren't out yet so I come to you guys with these questions. 1: when normally do summer internship applications get posted for the next summer (i.e. 2026 summer), 2: where should I look for those type of internships, 3: how many should I look to apply for (my goal is 300-500 because I know how cutthroat SWE internships are). True also wanted to ask more about leetcode, cause I don’t wanna go into SWE at all would it still be beneficial for interviews? I mean this summer I plan on getting some sort of internship locally, and work on my comptia security+ cert. Also plan on doing some messing around with a at home setup with vm’s and htb and websites like that. So would grinding leetcode be that beneficial??? thanks so much for the advice, if you had any time I would love to talk to you about your journey though applying for your internships and building up your resume in preparation for them. Right now i' m working on my security+ cert and I should have it completed by the beginning of July which is one thing that I plan on adding to my resume to really boost it. I added my resume into the resume review chat if u want to take a look at it and maybe give me a few pointers in the right direction that would be amazing but thank you so much again!!!", "answers": "1. Probably will be posted very soon, I wouldn’t really start worrying about it till like june though 2. HANDSHAKE!!! Easiest place to find job postings where recruiters actually respond 3. I think internships are generally easier to find than full time?? For context my 2 internships I applied to like 1 place and got an offer…first crappy full time offer took like 100 applications then good full time offer took like 400. Just work hard but don’t stress too much, everything always works out in the end Focus on leetcode but also (if this is your first internship) focus on what makes you a good choice as an employee. If you had a job before college think of what made you stand out from your coworkers. For your first few internships it’s going to be soft skills that set you apart, since you don’t really have any super marketable technical skills early on in your career. If it’s your first internship, a recruiter would want you to be a hard worker and able to learn, leetcode skills are definitely important but not everything most likely correct about internships being easier than full time, but that apply to 1 place and got an offer is definitely an outlier Ikr I like didn’t even have to try I feel like I accidentally got both of them lol like I was NOT qualified for either of them either tbh Shout out job searching in 2022-23 just shoot out applications until one hits (that u like) It def is disheartening to have to apply to so many but just remember that everyone is in the same boat as you does not help that companies will ghost you, or just take months to respond It probably would be beneficial even if it doesn’t directly tie into what you want to do long term. What’s nice about an internship is they only last like 3 months, so I’d recommend focusing on applying to exactly what you’re interested in (cybersecurity stuff), but also branch out to stuff you might not see yourself doing long term (like swe, also there is a lot of overlap with IT and swe). It will give you more potential opportunities, and cybersecurity might be a little difficult to find an internship in. It’s good to try different things internship wise because either 1. You’ll love something you thought you would hate 2. You’ll hate something you thought you would hate But it’s only 3 months, and you’ll make like $10,000 over the summer doing it. My first internship was more industrial engineering/steel manufacturing related. I thought I would hate it and I was right lol. But now I know an industry I definitely don’t want to be in which is at some point more valuable than knowing what you want to do. Also I’m guessing leetcode type questions come up for cyber/networks/it interviews. They are sort of used as a first filter for qualified and unqualified candidates. Practicing leetcode will also just make you better at dsa and will make you fully absorb the content from 445/1501 Hey! @Dante Warhola My last couple internships have been in cybersecurity - as it's something I really enjoy. 1. Soonish but I've had most luck for Cybersecurity in specfic from October - Febuary 2. I think Simplify, but then specfically going to IT internship can have a lot of great options 3. There is no where near 300 cyberinternships and it's also a lot less competitive than SWE - what's more important is how your resume stacks up against the job description happy to answer any other questions - hopefully that helps Yeah gladly would love to talk - I'm not sure if you've heard about C2C's Z2O program but that also has a lot of guidance, support and tips to navigating the internship space when it comes to resumes, applying, building projects etc. It'll be the first couple weeks of the fall semester"}

If viable, I'd like to take the online CS1520 so I could go home (correct me if this isn't how it works as the recitations are in person), and I was wondering if I would be fine to take the class having not taken the other lower level classes. Thank you! Ok great, thanks! cool cool is there a chance that an online synchronous class would have in person exams? or has anyone taken ferreira's async 1520 class ok so i would be completely fine to be home away from campus for the entire class alright cool, thanks again! ah ok, will do then", "answers": "The only pre requisite for 1520 is 445. 1520 with Paulo is very easy, it feels like an introductory programming course I personally found it much easier than any of those classes you listed (except 1503 which i havent taken) and it didn't require knowledge from any of them. Also if you have the time and like webdev checkout theodinproject.com the recitations will be in-person but aren't mandatory you could ask your TA to also hold them over zoom and/or record them but it'd be at the TA's discretion to do so or not no the lecture section doesn't even have a physical room associated with it, so that can't happen in fall 2022 the \"exams\" were actually just programming assignments, i'm not sure what he's doing now though @Leo Zhang im pretty sure it was just projects for my exams during summer 2023 yeah it was the same last semester (fall 2023), but *this* semester i tutored someone who said he was assigning a more conventional quiz or exam of some kind (i.e., multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, true/false etc.) but either way, yes you'd be fine taking the class completely remotely I am in 1520 this semester and it was scheduled to be completely online synchronous with no room...but we still had an in person exam With Paulo @Ben J where? In the IS building, I forget the room number. He sort of just did it with very little warning also that sounds kind of sus for him to do tbh but email him and ask him what his plans for the summer are @Max Wong"}

But you could also do that through heat levels or the amount of bugs let into a room or all types of things… Using water is neat bc you could use anything that could be aerosolized, meaning information could be encoded not only through the relative humidity but also through the unique chemical balance of the humidity. Or maybe not I’m out of my depth on the physics here.

If I take 1900, 1550, 1632, and MATH 280 in the fall, then I'd only have to take 2 more ULs in the spring before I graduate. Thoughts on this plan?

Even with a partner most of the work is individual 0280 is hard but if you start studying for the exams early it will rly save you from stressing during the exam weeks exercises atleast* I did 1550 w misurda and 1632 last semester and it was fine but agreed it just feels like constant deadlines for everything all the time. neither of them were super hard but you'll be spending all ur time on class, but if ur taking a lot of credits it's like that regardless how many credits are you suppose to mark for 1900? yep 3"}

{"text": "Tips for passing Misurda's 449 class? So it seems like I'm not gonna be getting off the waitlist for Jarrett's section anytime soon and I'll probably have to stick with Misurda this semester. I heard his projects were tough as hell and so far it's been kind of hard to follow him in lectures so is there anything I should keep in mind as I head into 449? thank you, yeah most of my worries are about office hours and taking notes since (admittedly) i crumble under any kind of social pressure. i'll probably have to get used to it over the semester when you were taking notes what method worked the best for you? i noticed that he tends to go on in a more traditional lecturing style and i dont really know what to focus and take notes on", "answers": "I had Misurda for 1550, not 449 but im sure most things apply. Make sure to ALWAYS go to lecture and take notes. His slides don’t cover most of the info he touches in class. Start the projects early, and honestly just grind them out. Also, the biggest thing is to not be afraid to ask for help. Misurda is scary, but I went to his office hours multiple k times when I was confused about projects and concepts, and even tho he was kinda mean, he really helped me understand stuff better. Despite not being very good at systems stuff or C, I was able to barely get an A- in his class because of these strategies Good luck!! You will learn a lot in his class for sure, he’s a great professor Reading the textbook will be especially beneficial, since he's the one who wrote it. Also, 449 is a programming heavy class, so take advantage of the UTA/TA office hours and begin projects as soon as you can. I personally took notes on my iPad / pencil + paper. I found that since there were a lot of concepts, it was important to write instead of type them. I made sure to take notes on a bit of what his slides had, but also really writing down what he is saying verbally, as those points are also really important I also made quizlets for the exams and those helped me do well def ask questions to misurda and the tas asap once assignments release since the instructions for his projects are usually not very clear Hi Im taking 449 right now and I am in the same boat so if anyone has any advice for this class with misurda please lmk struggling heavy did u read all the stuff above? yes I did Heavy emphasis on programming assignments. When I graded 449, many students lost points because they didn't fully understand what was being asked of them; so, definitely make use of (U)TAs and ask alot of clarifying questions Jon does curve exams towards the end (although maybe not enough), but personally think it's alot easier to earn points on assignments to make up for points you may lose on exam"}

I highly highly recommend Dr. Tan's computer graphics course, it's really easy and genuinely fun Would you recommend taking that course or starting first with machine learning (cs 1675)? Since ML is more broad i took it without cs1675, and although the math was a little tough to pick up in the beginning, i ended up doing fine the class shifts to be more conceptual over time i would study linear algebra if you don’t know it already as matrices are very important Seconding Digital Privacy with Garrison, it was a bit of work but you're the one deciding the exact subject for projects, so you'll be working on things that you're interested in specifically. Also functional programming with Tan(1699) if it gets offered again, it gets theory heavy half way through but the class is super light in terms of workload i think tans teaching that next sem, he’s posted for a 1699 i’ve only ever taken 1502 with him but he was by far one of the best profs ever, and funny too Probably last semester before it gets an actual class number I also would recommend cryptography w/ Garrison but its fall only also fair warning, this was with kovashka and jordan’s class could be dif — if quentin’s in it now, he can give a more specific review https://tenor.com/view/dead-x_x-dies-gif-24040993 this is deep learning you need to take CS 1510 - Algorithm Design ! it's super fun and you'll never regret it !"}

Some people find it really boring others (me) find it pretty interesting. Definitely easier and less time consuming than 1550 since all 1502 is 2 exams and straightforward homework, no projects or coding in 1502 Even if math isn’t your thing 1502 is def less time than 1550.

{"text": "Waitlist questions Hi, I am scheduling Monday and two of the classes I am scheduling are MATH 280 and ENGCMP 400. The section I wanted of ENGCMP 400 is full, but I am able to swap the times of ENGCMP 400 and MATH 280 so it isn't a big deal. I still plan to join the wait list for the 400 section I wanted since nobody else is on it at the moment. I am just trying to figure out how to do so now before Monday morning comes. Will it let me join the waitlist for a class if I have another class at the same time? If so, how do I setup my shopping cart to join the back up section of 400 and then drop that if I get into the one I want? Here was the first schedule (which is now full). The second photo is my backup one which I now plan to enroll in, and waitlist the other option. In the first schedule with the ENGCMP class I want that is full, the 280 class is 30/50. In the second schedule, it is at 57/75 It is linear algebra, and I think it is a pre rec for lots of future CS courses. I would guess a majority of people take it in their first couple of years of college, so maybe most people who will take it haven't scheduled it yet? Gotcha, even if I was #1 on the waitlist? It is only 20 people, so that doesn't really help I suppose Your previous messages make a lot of sense though. Getting into the one section I like could mess up being in a whole other course Yeah, I believe it is because there are no professors listed for any sections of 400 besides that one, and the professor in that one has fantastic reviews on RMP (which is the reason I would like to be in that one as well haha) That sounds like a good plan, thank you! Ill keep an eye on the other section if a spot just opens but like you said, it is unlikely", "answers": "when waitlisting for a class in highpoint (but not classic PS) you can specify a class to auto-drop if a spot in the class you're waitlisting for opens up, such that you'll automatically be dropped from the class you specify and then enrolled into the class you waitlisted for: the issue with your case seems to be that there are *two* classes you want to drop if you get into the ENGCMP 0400 section you want, and highpoint will only let you specify *one* class to auto-drop how likely is it that the MATH 0280 section in the first schedule you provided will fill up? since you can't be enrolled in two sections of the same course, in order to try and get the ENGCMP 0400 section you want, you would have to enroll into your backup 0400 section and then waitlist for the 0400 section you want, specifying your backup 0400 section as what to drop if you get into the 0400 section you want (otherwise you won't be enrolled into the 0400 section you want even if a spot opens up in it) but then if you're enrolled in a math 0280 section that's at the same time as the engcmp 0400 section that you want, you still won't be enrolled into the 0400 section you want if a spot opens up in it bc it'll conflict w/ the time of the math 0280 section you're enrolled in so you would have to *not* enroll in the backup math 0280 section until you get in to the engcmp 0400 section you want; but by the time you get into the 0400 section you want (if you do at all), the math 0280 section you *originally* wanted might have filled up yeah probably tbh i don't think you have a strong chance of getting into the engcmp 0400 section that you want, i would just opt for the second schedule you proposed to make sure you get both classes yeah the fact that it's already filled up so rapidly suggests that it's in pretty high demand, such that even being first on the waitlist may not be enough for you to get in yeah in principle you *might* be able to get in to your preferred engcmp 0400 section from being first on the waitlist, the issue is that you'd be gambling your math 0280 enrollment on it from looking at the math 0280 sections this current semester it looks like all of them fill up so to be on the safe side i would opt for the second schedule"}

Like unexpected challenges or benefits Thanks! This is great info thanks. I’m taking 401 and 445 now so makes me think I should think abt more for spring not fall Is there like a tutoring type of thing or something that’s a step down from TAing but in that realm? rad thank you all Hopefully dr garrison likes me", "answers": "1) depends on the class + professor. if you're TAing a class with the same prof that you took the class with yourself you'll already know how to do the assignments which makes your job easier, whereas if you're TAing for a different prof than you had yourself you'll have to learn how to teach/debug their assignments. also certain classes are just intrinsically more demanding for both students *and* TAs, e.g. 1501 versus 401 2) paid $12/hr, you can bill up to 10 hrs/wk per class assignment you have. so for example if you have one 401 section you can bill up to 10hrs/wk, whereas if you have both a 401 and 445 section (or two of the same kind) you can bill up to 20hrs/wk. you're capped at 2 assignments and 20hrs/wk though 3) absolutely 4) they want an `A-` or better in the class you want to TA, but an `A` or better is even better. ideally you should also have completed the next course in the sequence if there is one (for example, if you want to TA for 401 you should have already completed 445) 5) again depends on the class, but you can really get slammed by students asking for help leading up to the deadline for a major project or exam. you'll have to figure out how to navigate this and whether you can truly juggle helping students on top of your own classes during these \"peak\" times, or if you need to set boundaries and not give help outside of your OH/past a certain time of day/etc. w/ respect to discrete, i've never TA'd it but i've heard TAing for bonidie is not a good time oh and you're required to have 3 office hours per week per class assignment that you have. so if you have one class assignment you're required to offer at least 3 office hours a week, whereas if you have *two* class assignments you're required to offer at least *6* office hours a week yes, there is such a thing as being a peer tutor https://www.sci.pitt.edu/student-resources/student-success/academic-support-and-tutoring The hours for peer tutors are very flexible - you can just cancel any of your appointment slots if you're busy. remember to get a faculty rec It’s fine but he provides you with nothing and it lowk feels like you’re letting down your students sometimes You just gotta try your best and be independent with it but it helps for someone with garrison experience to TA it because then they can basically just follow what they did for him but tailor it to the speed of bonidies class"}
{"text": "What language is 1501 in? Should I expect more Java?

I think farnan once said he would make it with a lower level language if he could I don't remember. I took it a year ago right, the pseudocode is only meant to help with understanding the algorithms themselves at a conceptual level. figuring out the implementation is your job as the student let's be honest, knowing farnan it's prob rust :plrust: Probably, he loves it as I recall farnan said 1501 could be python because the content of the course is more about implementing high-level algorithms than anything else and fiddling with language quirks shouldn't slow you down, but yes the course is taught in java which I think is appropriate. it runs the same on most any machine and has a c-like syntax which is generally standard across many languages 1501 would be *so* much nicer with python comprehensions Let’s do the entire course in assembly YES! YES!

{"text": "why don't people leave ratemyprofessor reviews if you use RMP for your *own* benefit but don't leave reviews for *others'* benefit, it's tantamount to leeching without seeding i can understand not wanting reviews to be linked to your identity, but since RMP reviews are completely anonymous i don't understand why people can't take 2 minutes to leave one and help future students make informed decisions? i'd prefer bipolar ratings to unipolar ratings, like if reviews for a prof are *uniformly* negative i'll tend to avoid that prof, but if there's a smattering of reviews that say \"this prof actually isn't that bad\" i'm more likely to give the prof a chance my main issue is the small sample sizes for most profs' review pages. like if there's only 1-2 reviews for a prof that tells you essentially nothing. but once you have like 20+ reviews for a prof you can start to have some degree of confidence in the reliability of the ratings > So for me to put a review would make that prof's reviews lean toward bimodal, which helps nobody, right? not necessarily; i think farnan's RMP is the quintessential example of this https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/1894664 if his RMP was unimodal at 5 i'd be like \"FUCK YEAH I'M TAKING HIM,\" whereas if it was unimodal at 1 i'd be like \"no thx\" but by having a diverse range of scores, it indicates that whether you take him should be determined by what you're looking for; some people like him bc he challenges you and you learn a lot from his class, but others dislike him bc of his personality (likewise w/ misurda) the broad range of scores then lets you make an informed decision: what matters to me more, having a \"nice\" prof or a challenging one? @Anthony Arshoun strictly speaking farnan's (and misurda's) rmp *is* unimodal at 5, but nuanced s.t. i would research other options and ask myself what i'm really trying to get out of the class before i enroll in one of their classes in other words the nuance is good, imo i've left an RMP review for every single prof that i've had at pitt (in many cases, being the one to create the prof's RMP profile altogether) -- close to 100 ratings, only ~10 of which were either 5 or 1", "answers": "I think people are more likely to do it when they have a bad experience Honestly, RMP hasn't been super useful for me, firstly because I don't get a choice in professor for most classes anyways. But also, maybe I just learn differently from others, cuz the prof I see in reviews is never the prof I experience? Like, last year, one of my physics prof's had a 2/5 rating, but I thought he was actually pretty good, like he left so many resources to use and stuff like that. Little did I know that the rest of the class actually hated him and I couldn't relate to a single thing they were saying. I would have recommended him to others, but his score dropped to a 1.6/5 last I checked. I can't in good faith recommend him anymore because apparently where I found good things, the majority of students only found awful things. This has been a consistent experience: I love a prof for whatever class, and then I talk to other students and they say they wish they'd taken it with someone else. So for me to put a review would make that prof's reviews lean toward bimodal, which helps nobody, right? What do you guys think, am I just seeing this differently too? No you're definitely right this probably contributes to what you were saying too also yeah like you said, rmp is incredibly subjective Dang how did you read that so quickly lol My reading comp could never ngl i skimmed most of it but reading the parts i missed i had teh right idea Oh ok fair enough i am sadly 200 times slower when i actually have to read something for an actually important reason vibe reading master NO From my experience I have had some very bad highly rated professors and very good badly rated professors People tend to leave rmp reviews when the prof is either really good or really bad Also for CS classes at least I only found it useful for the first couple semesters, there really isn’t a choice of profs for upper electives, in that case the content of the class is more important than the prof really i mean honestly intrinsic characteristics can play a huge role in this (e.g. male/female, white/non-white, gay/straight, etc) bimodal not bipolar, statistical distributions don't have personality disorders lol. Also, the seeding and leeching phrasing from torrenting doesn't make sense in this case, because everyone's contribution in torrenting has equal informational value. That's not the case in rmp. 10 ppl talking about attendance policy is same as 2 ppl talking about attendance policy. an rmp score is different from an amazon review score as there are a large number of factors that make someone happy or unhappy with a class experience, while a classical \"product\" either works or does not work. for example, if a professor is not happy/reluctant about DRS accomodations, 90% of students won't care and their experience will not be representative for a person who does need accomodations, even if the 90% represent an overwhelming majority I do see what you mean, it would make people think about it more if there were differing opinions like that, which there definitely are in Farnan's case. I believe where my thinking was flawed was that I was just considering the score itself, not what people were actually saying. Like the scores could be uniform but every review says functionally the same thing, meaning the prof has some archetype by default and the way certain kinds of students interact with that is different. On the other hand, the scores could be unimodal, but every review says wildly different things, sometimes even contradicting other responses. I think the content of the reviews then is more important than the score given, because score is more subjective. A review that explains the way Farnan does things is probably better without a score because students can figure out how they feel about those things, instead of trying to compare how they feel to how this other person felt. In that case, I fully support a review system that attempts to describe how the professor does things, not as good or bad, but more list-like so students can decide for themselves if they would do well with that kind of professor. However, that kind of system still isn't immune to contradicting responses or half-truths, so I guess there isn't really a \"better\" option. For me it's helped a bit more to just talk to someone else who's taken that professor before, either in person or in CSC for example. That way, even if they are biased, the more natural kind of conversation leads to more details about the prof themselves. But again, most of the time I don't really get a choice anyways so I've learned it doesn't really matter what kind of prof I get, I just have to learn how to best deal with them. Which has been an incredibly helpful skill as far as just general social interaction too (not that I do a lot of that anyways...) But I appreciate your dedication to the reviews, as I've probably read at least one or two of them. And I will strive to do better with that in the coming years because I do now think it's important to get as close to an objective overall view as you can before one makes such an important decision for classes"}
{"text": "Why is 1510/1511 considered good to take for grad school? I am considering doing grad school (after a bit of working first though, not immediately after undergrad) and specifically for computational neuroscience. My advisor suggested taking 1510/1511 as they're good for if you want to go into grad school but I was wondering why that may be the case as 1510 is algorithm design and 1511 is intro to theory of computation (the latter does make more sense tho) and both courses are 1502-2.0-esque (but much more difficult). I also did fine in 1502 but maybe not as well as I would have hoped and my grade in that course doesn't really make me feel *too* confident about taking harder courses that are building on top of what 1502 introduced. But, I am still potentially interested, especially if it would be useful for what I'd like to do in the future. thank you for the responses! i was curious if anyone would also be able to provide insights into the workload of 1510? how many hours per week did you have to spend on the class to do well and how much were the actual hw/assignments outside of class? thank you! i have a couple of extra questions (sorry for bamboozling you with them haha i just like to be prepared): 1. what additional resources did you find useful for the course? 2. what would you recommend I do to perhaps prep for it over the summer? 3. which topics were covered (and if you don't mind sending over the syllabus if you still have it, that'd be awesome!)? 4. ik that students are \"expected to design their own algorithms\" which honestly sounds kind of scary - what was your experience with that like? 5. how was the grading for the course (i.e. did you find yourself struggling to receive a grade you thought was good for the course or any other inisghts you'd have!)?", "answers": "Because, at the very least, you need to take a harder version of them in grad school and having the background is very very very helpful there's other resaons too, like learning reasoning etc but having background in formal algorithms courses is very important source: i'm a current phd student on leave 1510/1511 are relevant if you want to do grad school in *pure* CS, and particularly if you want to do so *at pitt* if you want to go to grad school for computational neuroscience, and not necessarily at pitt, you'd be better off taking advanced data science/neuroscience courses (although 1511 would still be relevant for the more cognitive science aspect of neuroscience) To add even more examples, I think someone with a weak understanding of theory can still be a very strong e.g., MS in privacy engineering student. Algorithms are fundamental to computation and will be looked for in most strongly computational programs Taking 1510 (and the later grad level version of it) has helped a lot in my job working at an edge compute/cdn company And it helped in other aspects of my research Are either of you even in grad school? A lot and a lot Like 9 hours/week of hw in a group It's very hard lol 1510 and the grad version are they hardest courses I've ever taken @Vaageesha Das between 1510 and 1511, you'd be better served taking 1511 given your career aspirations (although even that wouldn't be strictly necessary) someone in my cog sci class who does computational neuroscience research isn't even a *CS* major, but a *data science* major https://schaefferlab.neurobio.pitt.edu/our-lab/ we've discussed turing machines and computability (i.e., 1511 topics) pretty extensively in the class (which is why 1511 *might* be useful to have), but not dynamic programming or the runtime complexity of algorithms (which are major focuses of 1510) Again, are you in grad school or are you applying for grad school? Please do not give advice on grad school if you aren't. For 1510: 1. There are a lot of other algorithm design courses with public lectures online about topics that are covered in the course 2. Could read those lectures but I did no prep and did fine. 3. The course website he has up is accurate: https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kirk/cs1510/ 4. It’s pretty difficult. “Easy” homework questions (2-4 pts) usually are slight variations of class problems and while the harder questions take more intuition or trial and error 5. Points based. Each homework has 3-5 questions of scaling points (2-8)and difficulty. You can choose one to solve and submit. Quizzes are two questions one from class for 10 pts and harder for 20 pts. You can only submit one for grading. He doesn’t believe in partial credit. Although sometimes the problems have multiple parts which you can get credit on. @Maddie Pratt yep, although it's a part time online program that my company is paying for so I can get some professional development. I also used to work at a research lab at CMU and published a bunch of papers. Didn't do so well in 1510 myself; that didn't hamper my research output though. Nor is not being good at algorithms/complexity hampering my current work (software security), where many of my coworkers have graduate degrees. One of the difficult things I sometimes have to say when talking to students seeking jobs is that a student might say they're \"interested in working on algorithms,\" and I have to break the unfortunate news that very few people do algorithm design nowadays. To be clear, it's a useful skill that I wish that I'm better at Correction/clarification: \"very few\" should be interpreted in relative terms, not absolute terms. @Vaageesha Das slightly off topic but worth mentioning: consider the opportunity cost of graduate school versus getting a job. Earning and saving money early on in life can lead to massive exponential growth. Oh I wasn't saying you had to do *well* in it, but having a basic familiarity is important imo I didn't do terrifically well in it either lmao same"}
{"text": "Why is there no NLP or dist. systems fall 2025: -anyone know about the status of an NLP class? I know this semester there was one but it was like \"Human language tech\". I see CS 2731 but only at grad level -also I dont really see distributed systems at any level -am I missing smth or will they likely create these later? Ah Are the lectures interesting? That’s mostly what I look for Okay Are all ML classes at Pitt a mess? I’ve been really impressed by most the core classes but feel the ULs can be hit or miss Ah. That’s honestly disappointing Are there any worth taking? I’m thinking Bias&Ethical implications of AI by Dr. Li because she seems to be good at research But otherwise from what you’ve described the others seem a waste of time if they all teach the same thing Alright thanks not important for me really. I like classes with interesting lecture i.e. anything Dr Farnan or Tan teach + learning I liked Li because it looks like she runs it in a research fashion (also love research) with academic readings Can anyone speak to her lecturing? And perhaps if the topic is interesting Most ethics classes I’ve taken are snoozers Meant to reply to this one Yes. Although Li encouraged me not to take this as an undergrad (I don’t remember why) Perhaps the “human lang tech” was suited better for undergrad I think he’s doing the grad version awesome", "answers": "Grad OS is distributed systems amy babay teaches 1652 as a dist sys class, idk about longfei it's also not uncommon for undergrads to take the graduate-level intro to NLP ling 1330 is also an NLP course based in the linguistics department I’m in NLP right now and I’m kind of not enjoying it honestly (it could be that it’s my first exposure to ml and I just don’t like ml, so you might enjoy it) Michael is pretty good but I def think he could be better. Almost like a little too much discussion in the class ig. Like he always gives like 15 min for discussion or an activity to do with other students and no one understands any of the topics so it’s kind of just like a waste of time imo. But he only just recently started teaching the class and he’s gotten better even from the first day of class so I think he’ll eventually become a really good prof Lowkey there have been like 2/6 cs electives I have taken and enjoyed here They’re all the same. I’ve taken almost all of them and they basically all cover the same exact things except 1 or 2 units that differ. CV and grad CV are the exact same, slide and assignments ML, data mining and DL are the same. Only difference is ML does some Bayesian, data mining does more clustering and DL does like 2 weeks more worth of NN If ur looking for new ml stuff maybe take nlp then. At least it’s a unique application of it. You do logistic regression, neural networks, then LLMs. Idk tho since it’s the only ml class I’ve taken I’d say they’re all worth taking if you’re interested in stat padding. Other than that, I’d say ML, DL and CV are prob the best basics. You’ll be bored in first half of DL after taking CV and vice versa but other than that it’s fine. To get into more theory or broader topics you’ll have to take grad level ML (2750) I haven’t taken an NLP course so my advice may be irrelevant if that’s your main interest I'm taking cs1699 special topics with Dr. Lee right now under the name \"Distributed Systems and Sustainability\" and enjoying thoroughly (didn't initially say distributed, but it is). Not sure if it'll be offered again next semester but definitely worth your time Li, Shi, and Kovashka are really good Don't like Jordan Haven't had Yoder, Nils, or Skeba Or Litman (idk if she teaches anymore though) Xiaowei is OK. Smart guy but dry lecturer/hard to get in touch with idk who teaches DL now, but afaik DL with kovashka is very diff from 1675 ML, it's all NN and beyond, as it should be tbh it might be worth taking it if you're interested in getting to know lorraine and/or her research networking and all that, given how she's prob one of the more \"prominent\" ML researchers in the dept frankly, you'll get a much better selection of ML classes by cross-enrolling at cmu whether you'll be able to actually get into any of those classes is a whole nother story it's computational linguistics specifically (so mainly linguistics and linguistically-informed applications), rather than NLP (which would be very computational) there's def *some* overlap in material tho (naive bayes, regexes, CFGs, etc) Her 1684 lectures were definitely interesting and engaging Sounds like you would also like Shi and Kovashka I mentioned elsewhere that taking 1675 or 1678 beforehand is helpful for 1684 though I thought CS 2731 was near identical to NLP--can anyone verify this? from what i've heard i think the major difference is that 2731 includes a major research project whereas 1671 doesn't necessarily also 1674 actually goes over some classical ML in the second half, so you could also take that as a precursor to 1684 It would be helpful to know the reason why Is he teaching NLP in the fall? if grad NLP is being offered and undergrad isn't, that alone should be sufficient for an undergrad to enroll into the grad version he said he is So what’s the issue with taking grad NLP then my guess would be not wanting to deal with undergrads potentially being underprepared This is w/ regards to the current spring semester Yoder is teaching grad NLP this coming fall And Li is teaching 1684 rather than 1671 babay is also teaching the graduate Wide Area Networks in the fall which is dist sys Grad os (2510) is typically taught as a distributed systems course and grad wide area networks (2520) is also pretty distributed-y I have ta'd both of those classes and they are very fun :3 I'm biased though because my PhD research is in distributed systems and also my current job is entirely in user space networking and distributed systems I honestly love my job and the work I do there lol #dist_sys_gang"}

The 70% is an approximation referring to the decrease in time and number of lines of code needed because React.js and Tailwind CSS are much more efficient and easier to code with than vanilla JS and CSS ", "answers": "hi, honestly looks great overall and good bullet points, my only suggestions are: 1. remove the location under your graduation (the university name implies it) 2. make sure the format of your projects are the same (e.g change your first project heading to Network Visualizer, Python, Vis.js, HTML and mention the award in your bullet points) 3. separate the languages and tools into 2 different lines in your skills don't put assembly unless you've done more than 447 lol what does 70% mean under real time weather app For 3 that’s fine, it makes it readable, but if you’re really worried about it you can make it side by side"}

Made changes to my resume based on the amazing advice I received here and upon completion of my internship. Further feedback would be greatly appreciated! Ok thank u guys so much!", "answers": "Actually I don’t have much to comment on besides paraphrasing these bullet points so they don’t take up 2 lines n get more space, I think it’ll make it slightly more readable, but overall I really like it (1) Make links \"https://\" (2) Include GPA if it's high (3) \"Normalized and refactored the database for an employee hours tracking app to Third Normal Form (3NF) using SQL, improving query performance for the web application\" could probably be rewritten to not mention \"normalization\" twice (4) \"Apple Metal\" -> \"Metal\" it's popular enough to just say this (5) Remove \"seamless\" it's not a term used to describe animations afaik (6) \"enhance simulation accuracy\" -> \"improve simulation accuracy\" (7) Remove \"enhancing user productivity and time allocation.\" (8) Put technical skills section after EC's (9) \"Helping to lead\" -> \"Helping lead\" ? (10) Remove \"enhancing resources for the Pitt CS community.\" fluff (11) Remove \"nsuring a seamless user experience and effective event promotion.\" fluff (12) \"school's\" -> \"universities'\" (13) Swap the order of the firefighter bullets. Overall very strong, I like it General rule of thumb is anything above 3.5, you can also report your ‘upper class’ gpa or ‘recent gpa’ for your most recent term, or major gpa No need to round you can just state that I think If your major gpa is higher I think that’ll look better in this case though you can see it on ps cx under degree progress iirc great work @Akash Krishan , love the resume. I would just say you can add some numbers for the CSC stuff. Some examples could be: - CSC's 300+ members - CSC discord's 1,100+ members - SteelHacks projected ~200 participants (prob hold off on this until real numbers but yeah) I think that looks really good tbh Looks great!"}

{"text": "Anthony Arshoun Resume Review Hello hello! This will be my second time posting my resume here, but hopefully it will be much better this time. This draft comes after the Zero to Offer resume review session, in which I have switched templates, modified info, learned some LaTeX, and hopefully not screwed up any formatting lol. I eagerly await criticisms and suggestions! Thank you in advance! Thanks for the input! Could you expand on what you mean by the spacing being \"really weird?\" Like should I make it bigger, smaller, indent differently/not at all, something else entirely? Oh nice! I'm not actually from Wexford technically, but I'm like 20 minutes out and that's where lots of stuff is lol (at least compared to Gibsonia) Ohh I see what you mean. Luckily that's actually an easy fix. Moving the bullet points left and right tho, I've no idea how to do in Latex properly lol Oh ok, I think I can change that. What about the Honors Degree though? Or does nobody actually look at that anyways? I thought that was honors distinction? Wait now I'm not sure lol Shoot I thought it was a separate paper Dang, I'm really going through 170 credits for one piece of paper... Wait and it doesn't even say what the major was either?? bruh Yea, now that I know this I agree too lol Ah I see, although I was hoping the education section would kinda front-run it (take up more space) since my projects and experience are heavily lacking actually I'm glad you mentioned that. how should I format it if its considered a double major in CS and Physics & Quantum Computing, but the latter is a dual major btw SCI and Dietrich? which is SCI ... sooo, what can I do to make it two papers? Take all the Dietrich gen eds too? Bruh Im doing 170 cus of honors and the bs+ms for cs hopefully But I can't take summer classes because of some credit limit now that im considered a junior so how am i supposed to do those gen eds... Unless... do they perhaps, overlap slightly? dang daaaaang hmmm thats a good point yea i did that a bunch already haha, but not for dietrich stuff so ill look into it ig yea thats true, but im upset nobody told me that last year when i planned all this stuff nah just everyone else lmao feel free to keep posting stuff here, but I got office hours now so imma dip for a bit", "answers": "you dont need to list honors college as a separate education but the formatting of education in general is just really weird i would use date ranges to clarify and just change the line gaps because it looks really weird (im also from wexford btw!) also, id add what class or dept ur taing for esp if its a phys or comp sci class Yeah I'll go in more depth after work I suspect the spacing issue is that there is too much between the degree and the relevant coursework. Compare it to your bullet points in your projects section—there’s like half the space Education should not be more than 3 max You can do something like this: “University of Pittsburgh, Frederick Honors College… dates” “B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Physics and Quantum Computing…gpa or location” I think having the “Frederick Honors college” there implies that it was honors degree (you don’t actually get a separate degree, which is kinda what you’re implying rn, you just get your bs’s and they mention the honors part) you get something like this what you currently have on your resume implies that you get a third paper (which you dont) @tejal gupta am I wrong on that? I got the honors degree And it was all one paper It's just given combined from both schools jointly Lol.it doesn't say it unless ur an engineer oh yeah thats just a pitt thing lol Tbh idk what honors distinction people get I think nothing but its still prestigious imo worth mentioning the honrs for sure, just...in less words and lines lol Agreed I'll send my updated resume as example When I'm back home Actually wait Do you have the file dastan? I can find it rq Well I didn't do a dual degree Also ignore some of my bullet points I need to update the stuff I do at my current job + my github Very annoying lol So with physics and qc You have a home school So it's not a dual degree It's a double major Where one major is a joint major Which sucks even more for u Cause you get one piece of paper Not two One degree  Sorry You need to fulfill all of Dietrich gen ed reqs And get 150 credits total Do u just need the gen ed reqs left So Overachiever;o You can take them at Pitt still Just not at cc A little bit But not completely Dietrich has much more to my knowledge But ur doing honors college So maybe overlap there too Id calculate the reqs urself by hand This is how I’d go about it tbh Better you found out now U missed the lore He has one degree Not two From 3 to 1 in one day is kinda brutal lol Lol they def don't advertise it enough Advisors are lk useless U didn't hear it from me thooo Well that changes things lol Yeah his physics and quantum computing home school is sci Not dietrich Wait now im confused on the diff between a dual degree and a double major Double major is from same school Dual degree has two options BS and BA Or two different schools Both require 150 credits Vs one degree (no matter how many majors) at 120 I'm literally in my cubicle Should be working but  Dual degree= 2 bachelors, double major = mix of 2 majors but 1 bachelor So would dual degree imply that you took twice as many gen eds than someone without a dual degree? Because itd be two degrees from diff departments? I think the dept has nothing to do w it, if you do 2 degrees (dual) you get 2 papers, if you do double you get one that says ‘double major’ iirc The idea of a double major is you go through like the absolute necessity of core classes for both majors w/out the extra electives n stuff required for the full things Ahh Crao i needa edit my education section as well then also not necessarily double the classes but *more* classes than a double major because you have to meet the requirement of the full fledges degrees individually like if you dual degreed in math and cs, you need to meet the reqs for a bs in math and reqs for bs in cs, but a double major would have mixed reqs for the two but still in same time frame as bs if that makes sense"}

The dean's honor list and honor list are both like pitt's thing for like GPA - is there a better way to phrase that in the resume? makes sense, sounds good", "answers": "(1) Put GPA as \"3.99/4.0\" becuase some schools use different grading scales (2) Normally I'd suggest against nested bullet points, but it honestly doesn't look too bad (3) Idk why you have 2 experience sections, I'd probably just combine them (4) I think it'd be better if the academic awards were mentioned in the eduction section. Style: - Some of the bullet points look a bit weird, esp the ones before \"B.S. - Computer Engineering\", \"Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute\", \"Society of Astronautics and Rocketry\", and \"FIRST and VEX Robotics\" Overall looks fantastic Hi, imo, I think the content overall is really good, my only area of improvement is to make it less congested, for example: 1. the heading could be condensed, I am not sure what editor you're using but I think you can move contact info up slightly to make space I think you can also remove the Bird Sanctuary project as well, I dont think technical recruiters will care about that much given your background also nice to see a fellow VEX enjoyer ha I did it for 3 years also also I would say you can remove the awards at the bottom because 'Dean’s Honor List (2021-Present)' is unclear, what organization was this? you started at pitt 2022, and similarly for 'Honor List (2021-Present)', the eagle scout is good, but I dont think its relevant Tbh I don’t think you need those at all, having your gpa there already is enough to say you performed well it’s implied If you want to explicitly mention you were in the honors school too, you can mention that in your education"}

Someone else will have to chime in there Just my personal opinion but if you bold more than ~20% of the text my brain starts to ignore the holding entirely and it’s harder to read. If I were making things bold, I’d keep it to either a few key tech names (node js, react, etc) or metrics of success (a million users) Looks wonderful to me, I do not have enough technical experience to understand all of it lol. The building feels fine now I may be wrong but aren’t css and maybe html not considered languages?

I know its not 100% gramatically correct yet but any comments on things that should be added/removed to the project descriptions would be appreciated SKILLS: Some slight changes just to make it fit Thanks for checking, any comments are appreciated I couldn't figure out ctrl k, but I just changed the colors to blue so they don't change from the default hyperlink color whenever they're clicked now Yes it is lol. I started as a civil engineer and do not believe in the sunk cost fallacy unfortunately for me. Its like almost 50 credits all in I think Would something like this for the type of work make sense and then remove the fully remote bullet point? ikr lol. I figure that it's better to just keep the formatting for all of the experience section instead of keeping it for 2/3 of it.

Every line is prime real estate Overall solid tho I’d preface your grad year w expected graduation: ___ minor in civil, crazy move, that minor requires more credits then some majors to be able to complete could put dean's list on the same line as GPA something like GPA: #.##, Dean's List: #/# semesters now im just imagining trying to be a remote server, bringing food to people with like a robot or something yeah, keeping it consistent is def the move"}

Also one has \"CITY, STATE\" and the other two are \"STATE\". (8) \"Automated reports and analysis of a database with thousands of entries using ThoughtSpot and Excel\" sounds a bit weird.

(12) Strongly consider moving school club participation and your awards to the education section as well. Style-wise I'd increase the font on your name a bit Overall looks really great! I like the bullets in the experience section. I agree with most of what @Nathan Barta , imo: 1. I dont think you need the 'HONORS AND AWARDS' section as it currently stands, your gpa being 3.95 speaks for itself 2. some of your experience bullet points are short \"Served all manner of guests in a start-up restaurant\" I'd remove them if they are non technical and if they are go into more detail about them 3. Assuming you free up the space, add as many bullet points as you can about your internships 4. make \"Clubs & Leadership\" all caps to make is consistent with the other sections 5. for the clubs and leadership times, make them date ranges and make them right aligned for consistency with the experiences (also do it for HONORS AND AWARDS if you decide to keep it) 6. \"Languages/Libraries/Frameworks\" feels like 3 lists combined into one, list each of those individuals if you can fit it in"}

Also do you have any suggestions for adding my contributions to PITT API. or should I put developer nect to club in organizations and when I did it", "answers": "Design/format: 1. I’d recommend left aligning your title sections, because it’s easier to read, when it’s centered like that the reader has to actively go out of their way to read it 2. Add a start and end date for your projects, I think it will look for impressive especially since one of them is a capstone which means it’s at least multiple months I assume 3. Instead of “leadership & Involvement” just say “Extracurriculars” 4. Also add a date for your extracurriculars most consistent with the other sections and it could show that’re your still active in them 5. I’d reverse the title for the extracurriculars and the organization (more consistent with the experiences) 6. Instead of “ACCOMPLISHMENTS & AWARDS” (also this is all caps but the previous one isn’t, if you’re going to do that make sure to do it for all your sections, attention to detail and consistency) make it “Achievements” 7. I’d maybe remove the date for that awards section I don’t think it’s necessary and it’s kind vague when you say spring 2023 was that 4months the entire term? If so that’s misleading or just occurred in the spring of 2023 term and was a couple day hackathon? I’d just remove the date, be more specific about it, or specify it was just a hackathon Content: 1. If you did a bs in cs and bs in ds, be specific about that as the way you currently have it leads them to think it was a joint program of sorts 2. Add a gpa if possible (cumulative, major, recent term are all options) you’re still in college 3. Add a relevant courses section again still in college 4. Try to be specific when it matters and leave details out when it doesn’t for example id say the ages of your students can be omitted in the IT intern role (it’s better to let them assume they were adults as it can show you taught more complex ideas) 5. “Assisted with debugging code, project backup, and computer clean-up” that seems like 3 bullet points in one, either make it 3 bullet points and go into detail, or talk about 1 Also a general good rule of thumb to follow for your bullet points is to mention frameworks/languages and stuff you listed for your skills in the bullet points to kind support why you listed them Obviously not all of the skill items can be supported as you might’ve used them in courses and what not but try your best to do that But yeah overall I’d say the formatting and content are solid just those minor adjustments would push it over the top imo If you do add a gpa id remove the deans list, nobody cares about that really the gpa will speak for itself For the gpa yes you can say something like “(recent term GPA:…)” or “(Spring 2024 GPA:…)” I’d honestly just put it right after your degree if you want to save space and talk about your relevant courses For the fellow role, if it’s been longer than a month then I’d def mention it especially if it’s a paid experience and add some bullet points, if not you can list it but just don’t add any bullet points as it’s recent A yeah a “B.S in Computer Science and B.S in Data Science” works something along those lines I’d personally recommend not doing that, because it’s inconsistent, you have a date for education but a term for the gpa I’d keep them next to each other This is better imo You can put it there I think that’ll look good For the Pitt api I’d put that under extracurriculars as it’s not a personal project That looks good you can also do like in parenthesis (Pitt API) but yeah If you had heavy contributions then you can move it to projects and talk about it in detail w bullet points but you may need to shorten some of the other projects to make space for it Also when you add your date ranges be careful with the type of dash that you use (there are different lengths) I know these might seem like miniscule details but they matter, remember your resume is your first impression, your presentation, so if you’re not consistent then they’ll assume you don’t care about details"}

I know professors have mentioned in the past to be careful about posting projects anywhere, so I've held back on putting them on my github.

For example, I'll reverse the logic for paging, or maybe I'll change the implemented opcodes in my Logisim CPU.

After moving them to the left, it also looked easier to read. Just my two cents, I don’t think it matters too much. - Not sure what C&IB and PINACLE mean. They sound like internal terms, which is fine if you’re targeting PNC or banking, but I’d make it more general or easier to understand for a wider audience. - All the links work. - For “Implemented a playable VR experience,” adding numbers would help. Think about number of users, hours of testing, or something measurable. - “Conducted user research” could use a clearer outcome. If it led to a beta launch, pivot, or key insight, spell that out. For example: Interviewed 100+ users to inform the launch of an experimental shopping app and uncovered friction points around checkout. - Most bullets follow a similar structure. Try applying XYZ format where possible to highlight what you did, how you did it, and what impact it had. - Overall very good. @David Shi Since you mention fulltime in summer 2026, are you planning 2026 graduation?

{"text": "Jayden Kelly Resume Review Hello! I am a freshman in Comp Sci. I have a lot of experience with programming as a hobby in middle and high school, and also from courses in high school. This is more of a general purpose resume that I would like to use for internships and also student employment, so I have included not just tech experience, but also some other work experience and awards that show off other soft skills. I also included high school under education and for a project despite being told not to by a CSC officer. This is because my resume would be bare without it (I also read that it's okay for the first few semesters). Will it be an instant reject, or do the pros outweigh the cons as I thought? I would love any and all feedback so that I can make adjustments before the career fair tomorrow! Nothing is too small! I checked it for spelling and grammar but I definitely could have missed things. Thanks in advance!", "answers": "> I also included high school under education and for a project despite being told not to by a CSC officer.

{"text": "Jerry Chen Resume Review Hi, I'm a grad student who is finally learning how to actually get a tech job. Any feedback on my resume would be appreciated! This is my first time getting a review in any capacity so don't hold back. Thanks! I def need to implement the X-Y-Z some more but i feel like it makes the bullet points go too long... is it okay for them to be multiple lines? I already was struggling to fit everything in and had to cut a few big projects off I'm starting the project this summer, still ironing out details with Nils Ya i was debating to put it in there but it is a huge role and time commitment as it is a job rn and I did do some data analytics stuff in it I was gonna put some of my class projects like for NLP I was part of a group doing Omnibus Bill tracking (Seeing how a bill changes and evolves as it goes through iterations until it finally ends up in a big bill with multiple differnt bills) and how bills are repeated between states could you explain the resume filter part? Like how would it help get past it Yeah I see your point, its sorta just glaring difference lol \"Graduate Assistant Swim Data Analyst\" idk maybe I dont have much tech experience cuz i spent the last 6 years of school swimming 20+ hours a week lmao more Athlete-Student than anything else and finally got a wake up call like bro ur cooked for a job i appreciate the feedback so far! thank you! Yeah theres not really any formal focus but I've been interested in AI/ML/Computer Vision (Like everyone in the world now). I still have another year left, graduating expected April 2026 I'm doing my project with Computer Vision and i'm tying it with my thesis for Sports Science. For Sports Science, i'm doing a a study lookng into the correlation between shoulder mobility and 15m start times for swimming. I'm gonna have to be labeling my own datasets for that so i figured I'd try to build a model or modify an existing to help me do that. And maybe compare human measured to computer measured goniometry I'm still not entirely sure what field I end up want to go into still now tho but i'm leaning towards Computer Science/SWE and in my dreams maybe Quant Dev Not much more self-guided projects in that realm since ML and AI classes had very structured assignments/projects, maybe in the Grad level ML class this fall we will I just started doing side projects in my free time after decided to step back from Semi-Pro Swimming this past year I did one on testing the impact of implementation language on performance of the Raft Protocol (Since I saw you were into Distributed Systems). I think I found that Java implementaton was faster than the Rust one I also did 3 projects on privacy since that class was 3 projects purely on your own 1: How attackers might use timing of Bubble Sorting a dataset to gather infromation on the dataset and how to Mitigate these attacks 2: This is overdone but using ML to detect outlier accesses of systems for security 3: Preserving Anonymity in social media graph datasets using k-anonymity, l-diversity, and differential privacy results were really bad on all three tho THey sound interesting but nothing meaningful came out of them unfortuntely It was for a grad OS Class so it was purely focused on Distributed systems and this was a group project, my bad i didn't clarify this Yeah i found it surprising that Java was faster and our hypothesis was that Rust was going to be faster due to the Memory Management and Concurrency differences between the languages. And that Java was just slower in general. This was a limited scope project so I just used two exisiting implementations: xraft for Java and OpenRaft for Rust We tested the two implementations by sending client requests at a dozen to a few hundred requests per second and timed them. Start up a cluster of 3 serves, then we used a script to contact the leader with a number of write requests and the same number of read requests and timed how long the script took I think the reason Java was faster in this instance was just due to the differences of implementations of the protocol but we left it at that and didn't dig deeper to find out why. We did not at all I'm not sure, I made it one entry since the work I did in the first summer continued into the next summer. If it was differing work, i'd make two entries", "answers": "i definitely think that swim coach should not be where it is and as detailed as it is did you do a thesis for your masters or a project? so if you don't have your masters yet you should put 'expected' or something imo i mean what other 'big' projects do you have that you can put there instead of like 6 lines of swim coaching? ah that's fair, i'm just not sure that the job title is... necessarily a great way to get past a resume filter at least imo that legitimately sounds impressive to me and would be good to add okay so like, idk how the llm based ones work, but like... genuinely if i was a recruiter and i saw \"graduate assistant swim coach\" as a big header under experience on a resume it's just like... it looks super irrelevant i guess? even if the bullet points are? like if you're giving it a quick scan like, the actual bullet points are okay, but like, i would try to find a way to make the job title sound a bit 'tech-y'? like add something about analytics or something i guess if you can? of course! if it helps, here's my resume that got me an interview that turned into a mid-level software engineer position at cloudflare and also the discussion thread i made about it here lol https://discord.com/channels/729022532874797146/1273849375805800549/1273849375805800549 of course! i'm gonna keep looking at yours real quick since i just shut my work laptop a little bit ago and have to kind of kill time until my pickup hockey game tonight lol (also the 15 second slowmode in here is genuinely infuriating and disruptive to actual discussion lmao) one thing that will probably help both the actual resume and let me evaluate what changes to make better is like... letting me know what you focused on in your masters? like, i guess i'm not 100% sure if that's a thing that happens in a masters outside of like... the project or thesis but oh, that's really cool! can you let me know what other projects you have other than this one? https://discord.com/channels/729022532874797146/1364713286188400681/1364729583961899150 like that you've done independently or class projects (individual or group) I did one on testing the impact of implementation language on performance of the Raft Protocol (Since I saw you were into Distributed Systems). I think I found that Java implementaton was faster than the Rust one out of curiosity, was this for grad os or grad wan or something else? i'm also genuinely surprised by that result and how you arrived at it, and if you have the time to i would actually love it if you could talk about it a bit. also, i'm not *just* asking because i'm interested in distributed systems and fault tolerance (though that's a part of it ), but also because it is legitimately a good skill to have to be able to describe your projects to people. like, at least here at cloudflare, from what i understand the interview processes that my team and the teams sort of 'around' it do for candidates start with a 'hiring manager' interview, which is with an engineering manager (even if it's not necessarily on the team you initially are targeting) to like... vibe check basically lol. at cloudflare, they're generally like... introducing yourself and giving some of your education and employment background, the em asking some semi-technical questions (verbally) to see if you have like... basic internet/network protocol knowledge, and to see how you communicate it, and then usually they'll ask you about a project you did and like... have you talk summarize it and then they'll ask questions about it to get more information on like... how you communicate in general, how you think about problems and stuff like that Cool! Followup question: did you simulate latency? if you intern somewhere more than once, is it typical to make it just one entry? or if the work differed could you make two seperate entries on the same company? I see you did just one, I have been unsure myself."}

If you have any questions about anything, please let me know https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianjalkh/ Also, curious if I should add any other socials to my LinkedIn or resume Yeah, IS is my major They also call it Information Sciences, they're interchangable names but it's the same thing So would I call it BS in Information Systems then? Although I'm a freshman so I'm currently studying for it, I don't have it And I just put all the courses cause @Nickhil Niranjan suggested I do that, wasn't sure whether I should put all of them or not I also did that plus put some of my high school courses that are relevant to my listed skills or are AP classes on LinkedIn Oh so like - - - Or like should I number them Oh ok The way FlowCV does it tho is when I add a section, it will do the header like you see in the resume So it would be like Yeah this was just an example So I should take out seminar, anything else? What would you recommend for the others? I know I could probably do Big Ideas in CompInf like that Also, I removed the interests section I had before to try and make sure everything would be on one page, should I have kept it?

Maybe don’t include the intro courses (like Big Ideas and Seminar) 7. Include only relevant courses to the position you’re applying for 8. Don’t use the dot things to indicate skill level, just list them like the others 9. If you’re applying to anything related to tech, no need to put “(Programming Language)”. dont put all of them, also def dont list skills and classes in individual bullet points you want em to be like a horizontal comma seperated list “Classes: Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, … Class *n*” like this (dont pay attention to the actual content of this screenshot i am still giving my resume a makeover) also dont list them by semester is flowcv like kinda codey? if it is then you can probably edit the formatting code of that section somewhere that was a terrible explanation so if someone else wants to translate what i just said thatd be welcome id put coursework as a bullet point in the education section also dont include first year seminar id \"rename\" your classes like instead of analytic geometry and calculus 1, you can just say Calculus 1 nope you could do Computing & Information, but once you get more classes on your resume I'd just take it out dont like abbreviate stuff just say it with less words Yeah I'd put Computer Science for that first class maybe sure it sounds a bit weird cuz that is the major but one of my classes for my 2nd major is literally the name of the major that should be fine(I think?)

You can put them in like a bullet point starting with \"Coursework:\" or something similar - I'd put Betsy's place under experience, although ofc once you start getting college opportunities you'll likely want to take out Betsy's place and Best Buy.

Feel free to ask me to clarify if something doesn't make sense! I'd still put it and the experience under the same thing, also you can take out \"professional\" and just keep it as \"experience\" since any experience you put on the resume is proffessional enough to go on a resume only thing to mention is that you can put your major in this section(o i rhymed) where the hyphen currently is I'd recommend overleaf but a lot of people use different things Remove photo as well"}

Example: the very last bullet point goes onto the second line just to say \"transitions\" so either have 1 line or 1.75 lines+ - Generally follow the XYZ format for bullet points if possible: https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.html **for example** \"Instead of \"Worked with co-workers to navigate hardware, software, and networking issues for a variety of local businesses,\" consider \"Collaborated with team to resolve hardware, software, and networking issues for over X local businesses, improving system efficiency by X%.\" - You don't need need to state your skills under each experiance - I personally feel this is reduendent since its stated at the bottom but others have differnet opinions. - Proofread your resume some more: \"python\" should be \"Python,\" and \"Utilized scripting with python and Batchfile\" should maintain consistency in capitalization. **overall really good just some minor fixes** I didn't read bullet points too indeapthly but try to fix what's above, and then resend it and i'll review again @Liam Brem Yeah put 2027 if you think you can genuinely graduate then This is looking super solid - another tip is in the header, leave it hyperlinked but make it black and get rid of underline it looks better - Bold your name if it isnt already - don't use articles (a, the, an) -> rather than \"Utilized a simple CI/CD method to ensure there was a usable product during the later stages of development.\" **instead write** \"Utilized simple CI/CD method to ensure usable product during later stages of development\" it's just more consise and lets you add more info"}

I am struggling to develop the description of my internship from this summer since my code was not actually deployed and used so like there aren't any stats like \"decreased blank by blank %\". Also any other suggestions would be appreciated, thank you! Ok cool, thank you! So my internship was Microsoft New Technologists. We were in groups of 5 and went through the full product development lifecycle. So we did PM (brainstorming, prototyping, user-testing) and then we did the SWE aspect where we developed the product using React, Bootstrap, Google Maps API, and Firebase. We came up with an idea that is kinda like FB marketplace but for produce surplus. My part was I connected the user's information across the pages. So for their login, shopping feed, and shopping cart. And then I did some UI stuff The research was with the PAWS Lab. I was working with a past professor while he was finishing his PhD which was kinda like a duolingo but it used the CS0007 and CS0011 curriculum and was made for pitt students. They use the system for 0007 and 0011 students now. But basically I used d3.js to make models to effectively display student progress. And each cell was connected to mock data which was just in a json file", "answers": "I’m not sure if the first bullet point of Microsoft is really needed Your format and all looks great Can you elaborate more on your research position?

I haven't gotten a page yet lol 6. that's fair! 7. full time, was broken up by TAing 8. that seems fair but i'm not 100% sure how i'd break it up lol 8. also i'm worried about space there too lol that's fair 4. partcipating in on-call is actaully an Importan Thing sometimes tbh SRE stuff like i have to be ready to answer a page and potentially fix The Internet there was a whole interview on site reliabilty engineering in my interview process for fastly i guess the thing here is that like, we almost never get pages (i haven't gotten a page yet and the last major page event was like some number of years ago when we accidently Broke The Internet) but i think it's important to show that i do on-call and not just push code if that makes sense? so fastly is a CDN + edge compute platform so like, in this case an outage can literally take down a large chunk of the internet it's not like idk reddit going down or w/e where it's one website it's like... if we go down reddit + yelp + spacex + NYT + [...] go down my on-call rotation covers more than just my product we just ~restructured~ so i'm not 100% sure how many/what prodcuts *are* covered by it but it's more than just fanout yep that makes sense update: i just got an interview with the original resume at cloudflare now the imposter syndrome is kicking in Literally just had a panic attack bc it's for a senior swe position And it represents an increase of at least 35k/year okay interview in 2 hours we'll see how this goes lol Technical issues kept it from happening, gonna work on rescheduling tomorrow lol Okay rescheduling the interview thursday at 2!", "answers": "What’re you aiming for? At your experience level I think I can try and give more specific tips I see okay Looks really good overall, these are minor suggestions but I'd recommend 1. Removing the diamond icon in the heading, it makes text parsing difficult especially if you need to go through ATS, the | pipe is more common 2. I'm not sure if you need to mention the \"(on leave)\" part, if you can, leave it out, it appears more consistent with the other dates 3. I'd add bullet points under your PhD education, the first one being your relevant courses, the second being 'research areas', and just move it there (inline list preferably to save space) 4. I'd remove 'Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm' from your skills since you mentioned it in your summary, and focus more on actual software for that section 5. \"Participate in on-call rotation as product support\" could be a bit more specific, what product issues did you address and how? 6. Instead of \"2007 - 2012, 2017 - 2020\" for bachelors education, it's standard practice to just put the year and month it was conferred e.g just mon 2020 7. Is the grad student research role part time? if so I think you can just put (Jan 2020-Aug 2023) 8. For academic projects, I'd maybe add a title that describes what the project was used for and then the description 2. for the leave, I think you can do something like PhD - Computer Science (on leave), University of Pittsburgh... I think its a minor design choice but I am a consistency freak 3. For the research area if you do something like \"research focus: Intrusion Tolerant Distributed Systems, Secure Cloud-based Systems, Trusted Execution Environments\" as a 2nd bullet point I think that will save space 5. I think I would remove \"Participate in on-call rotation as product support\" then since it doesn't really add anything to showcase specific skillsets, should free up some space too 8. you could something like \"title (in bold): what you currently have\", also you wouldn't need bullet points if you do it this way ultimately these are minor tho tbh, I doubt recruiters would care about these details at your experience level in that case yeah maybe just dive into more detail, like mention some of the common issues youve addressed in the past for that Yeah I see hm Do you have customers for the site could you do something like “Participate in on-call rotation as product support to address urgent technical issues for the site”? Oh you were being literal holycrap Then I’d DEF mention that specifically In that case maybe like “Participate in on-call rotation as product support to maintain critical World Wide Web infrastructure”? But I’d add something specific in the middle like was there any specific service or app? In that case yeah not sure, you’d know more about the specifics, but if I’m understanding correctly, I’d def not leave the internet part out mention it somehow regardless of how you phrase it If I was a recruiter and saw that I’d find it impressive You got this, I think you’re plenty qualified tbh for senior, phd + industry experience I was just reading along and even I am curious now haha. how did it go?

{"text": "Maoz Yoav Resume Review Hello! I'm applying for summer internships (and ready to suffer). Please help me make my resume good lol. Ty for the help in advance. How's this? I probably should have written down the things I did in the internship lol. But the bullet points should be better! Anything else that stands out that should be fixed? I'm going to reword the \"set up\" part in the extracurriculars, but that's not something I'm worried about lol Ohhhh Nah I get it The internship didn’t have anything special so there isn’t much to write about As in, put discrete structures or nothing for 441?", "answers": "Good format overall, I think you should 1. rework your bullet points though. You want to be very specific, talk about what problems you solved, and try to quantify them (if possible don’t try to force it, recruiters can see through it). A good rule of thumb to do this is to mention the skills you have in your technical in the bullet points descriptions (e.g used x to solve y resulting in z) 2. Try to add more bullet points preferably to the internship role as it’s the most relevant to technical recruiters you can add it to the projects too but prioritize the internship. If that’s not enough you can add a relevant courses list just make sure to aim for one full page when it’s all said and done 3. If you’re still having trouble reaching 1 page you can also add projects from classes (just don’t publish them) This is better but it could be improved even further, specifically your internship bullet points. Learned x y languages and frameworks / became familiar with enterprise software / used version control etc are generally not a good idea, those are basically job requirements, anyone can do that. Some recruiters even see them as fluff bs and will assume you didn’t have enough content to highlight your achievements. You want your bullet points to make you stand out especially in this competitive market. You want to show them the results of your work. For example you talk about fixing 2 bugs a week, what were some of those bugs? Talk about them specifically, how you fixed them, and how it made their system better this will show recruiters that you’re a good problem solver and you bring a set of analytical skills to the team and make you valuable For an internship 2 bugs a week sounds like a slot so just use your judgment and talk about the ones that are noteworthy Also I noticed there are some repeating words, try to switch it up and use action words or synonyms, or if you absolutely need to use the same word spread them out so it’s not as noticeable I still think you can be more specific... \"Handled 1 to 2 bugs a week, freeing up time for other developers to focus on meeting other deadlines\" is not telling employers what problems you can solve or what you excel at, it's good that you focus on results but what are the bugs you are talking about? race conditions? buffer overflow? segmentation faults? name them directly Also name the frameworks specifically that you used, for example instead of \"Primarily fixed front end issues, including one that branched between multiple components\" try \"Improved the user interface of application x by fixing component y in [framework] z\" instead of \"Created a file-based database to store each individual character\" try \"Created a file-based database to store each individual character in SQL to achieve [goal] \" you used \"helped\" twice and \"periodic\" twice, try to switch it up maybe \"aided\" or \"biweekly\", you want to avoid repetition because those are the details that employers especially technical recruiters care about, you want to show them that you are a problem solver Apply those concepts to all the bullet points (especially your Software Intern role since that's the main thing they'll care about, I'd say its okay to let it even take up half the page) and I think you should be good Sorry if that wasn’t clear I suck at english lol That’s how I felt about my internships as well, but if you dig enough there’s always more to write about, I found this to one an iterative process you get used it (1) I'd include coursework as a list within the education section (2) If \"Discrete Math\" refers to Discrete structures, don't do that bc our course focuses on stuff more relevant to cs & more importantly omits stuff that is covered in most standard discrete classes (at least the one at Pitt which is the most apt comparison). I def agree with Dastan's recommendations Discrete structures"}

The bullets flush left is weird to me, as well as the large space between them and the text. See if you can reduce it. 12.

{"text": "Nickhil Niranjan Resume Review Hi hello I'm applying to Summer 2025 internships in a few days, my resume is shoddy at best so please be brutally honest. A few sidenotes/additional questions right off the bat: - Should I make seperate coursework lines for each major? - The Teenie Harriss Project is still technically ongoing and it might be going further past august, however everything i said in the bullet points has already been completed and i feel like it would be less impactful if I put it in present tense because it implies i havent quite finished it yet, which is why I just put August 2024 as the end date. - Since this is for Summer 2025 internships., should I add coursework I'll be taking this fall? If so, I wouldnt also put potential coursework for spring, would I? Since that's not even close to being scheduled yet so that would be straight up potential lying. With that out of the way, please flame me pls and thank you Sounds good! Ill be applying for stuff starting tomorrow, any last suggestions?  Sounds good, thank you so much! I shot you a dm as well Splitting the courses by major makes sense, but as of right now I've only completed one DNID course so it might look a bit empty. Should I also include the classes I'll be taking this fall? The only downside(albeit a big one) I can see is potential employeers assuming I already completed the course and asking me something I don't know during an interview although that scenario would be more relevant to the cs classes Alr, so I made some pretty significant revisions I think. Any suggestions? Oh also: 1. The reason the bullet points in the VR project have different tenses are because I wanted to distinguish what I've already done vs what I'm currently working on/starting 2. I did remove Jira from the Skills section, but was later advised to put it back on, so that's why it's still there", "answers": "Would not use \"colluded\" You can make a nicer linkedin url in the [public profile settings](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/settings) I’ll give my feedback later tonight heading: remove your pronouns, it can introduce bias against you education: (option 1) if you do decide the current format, make it clear that you will recieve two bachelors e.g something like \"bs in cs and bs in dnid\" because currently it implied it was some sort of combined program which is 1. less difficult 2. pitt doesnt have it (option 2 recommend) if you want to add relevant courses for dnid too you can do something like this: upitt bs in cs (gpa:...) relevant courses:... upitt bs in dnid (gpa:...) relevant courses:... obviously I am paraphrasing but that's how i'd format that (I also use this for my own resume) experience: 1. remove the sales associate experience, technical employers wont care about that tbh 2. your internship bullet points need work... you need to be more specific to show them you are a problem solver for example \"ssisted in the development of software\" what software? language? libraries did you use? \"improving\" how? did you make it faster? less resource needs? how did you go about that, what did you bring to the table? A general rule of thumb is to follow the 'star' rule (situation, task, action, results) obviously that wont be possible for every bullet point but try your best, the key is being specific it's also okay to let your bullet points to take up 2 lines, just make sure to use the space wisely and reach 1 full page Also you want to sprinkle some of your tech in your skills section in your bullet points e.g (\"used language/framework x, to reduce memory usage for app y, resulting in more performance z (a number preferably)\") projects: good overall 1. I'd rewrite the bullet points similarly to what I said about experiences skills: 1. remove vscode, slack, jira, those are skills anyone can learn, it doesnt show your uniqueness (unless you did very specialized things with them in which case mention it in your bullet points) 2. HTML and CSS are not languages, make sure to categorize your skills listings also feel free to dm me if you want help with rewriting the bullet points, ik it can be hard to get used to that writing style at first Also your LinkedIn hyperlink is not working it says page not found For the other major you can just list it as ‘planned courses’ or something like that, but I will say in this case it might be better to stick with the other format just make sure to mention the bs for both"}

I am in both of those classes rn, so I don't have any projects from them yet unfortunately. soon no real projects from 401 also i'm really hoping to get some thoughts on the order of the resume sections if you or anyone has thoughts on that.

I would recommend just having one experience section, being a UTA is not 'technical', but you can focus on it as its the closest to relevancy by the # of bullet points (use 3 bullet points for the UTA role and 1 max for the others), and order it like this: education->projects->experience->skills->publications right now projects are the only way to show your technical ability to recruiters so I'd highly recommend you focus on improving that section Also what’s the future position that you’re talking like what’s the Title n responsibilities? You can just put it down but don’t have any bullet points for it Or if you want to add bullet points you can use future tense like ‘incoming’ or something I think you’ll be fine either way for that tbh Btw don’t try to over sell this if you do add it, be honest about say, I’m an incoming research assistant that’ll be working on project x that was made in frameworks yz, recruiters see through that shit"}

If I had to nitpick: - Bullet 3 for your Amazon experience seems a bit out of place. I'm guessing all three bullet points relate to a speech recognition project? Maybe there's some way to tie them all together better? - Tailwind CSS and Express.js are mentioned in your projects section, but not your skills section. It's not necessary, but you could include them in the skills section. AWS could also be included in the skills section if you are familiar with the client surfaces of AWS products. Yeah that looks great! Looks good overall! * Consider shortening the related coursework section. You can drop the \"introduction to\" and just put \"systems software\" (same for data science) * Add your GPA if you think it will help your application * Add links to your project section if you're okay with the interviewer looking at the code (most places won't take the time to) * Consider getting a bit more technical with your Amazon position description. You mention Java and ECS, but was there more to the tech stack? I would have that on the first line of the description. The internship is the most important part of your resume so I think you could add another bullet point if you have more to say.

{"text": "Rhonda Ojongmboh Resume Review Junior standing but transferred into CS late thus no internships as of yet:FeelsStrongMen: . looking for most backend roles, but I think I'm eliminating myself from most roles because my resume seems to be asking for only fintech internships", "answers": "- Customize your linkedin URL to remove the random numbers at the end (you can do this from settings) - Remove professional summary - \"Bachelor's, Computer Science\" -> \"Bachelor of Science in Computer Science\" - Put coursework under one bullet. Ex: \"- Coursework: Algorithms and Data Structures 1/2, Calculus 1/2/3,...\" - Separate the skills in the skills section into categories - What does \"self sustaining\" mean in the context of quadcopters? - \"complex logic\" it's a spades game, the logic isn't really that complex - For your riverhounds experience, your verbs are in past tense, but you have marked that you are \"Present\"ly doing it. Check out the pinned \"Guidelines + Format\" post I agree with everything Nathan said. I think removing the professional summary would open up more opportunities for you than just fintech. I was in a similar boat with you in terms of major switch (civil engineering -> cs) and some unwarranted advice from my experience of getting my first internship after the switch was to look local and to look for something similar to your first major, but that also has crossover into anything at all relevant to cs. Some things that I would also recommend: - Remove your location, most job applications require you to specify your location, having this could limit you with job selection - Mention some course work or projects from your previous major maybe. From your coursework I'm guessing you were some type of engineering or other stem field which could be very indirectly relevant to CS - The Quadcopter project sounds very interesting and relevant, definitely expand on that. Are there any numbers/statistics that you could talk about? I think expanding on the quadcopter project and including some context about switching majors late (and why that potentially makes you a better candidate) could be beneficial to you. Switching majors late is definitely difficult but just stay positive, keep grinding, and everything will work out"}

Computer Science & Data Science\" can sometimes be confusing bc it may appear as a joint degree. imo \"B.S. Computer Science, Data Science\" is better - \"Relevant Coursework\" -> \"Coursework\" bc no irrelevant coursework should be making it onto a resume - Some bullet points don't have periods - \"strengthening authentication & automating playlist creation.\" can be cut - I'd put \"Developed data visualization pipeline with matplotlib and scikit-learn, delivering safety insights via heat maps and confusion matrices for comprehensive model evaluation.\" as the 2nd bullet point so readers can imagine what the project looks like before reading through the other points - Certifications is a bit hard to read, maybe use semicolons: \"Advanced Learning Algorithms, Stanford University via Coursera; Convolutional Neural Networks, Stanford University via Coursera; Regression and Classification, Stanford University via Coursera; Foundations of BI - Data Models and Pipelines, Google Business Intelligence via Coursera. Neural was Misspelled. Overall looks great. Good work incorporating feedback from the first review.

So 3.7 instead of 3.67 Agree w Jayden no need for dev tools like VSCode id also suggest cutting down on whitespace a tad i think it should round to 2 decimals, handshake does that by default Oh word, good comms - “Decreased search time by 2 days by determining the best deal per day” reads awkwardly maybe rephrase for clarity - Was this literally your brother? Feels informal phrasing like “emailing my brother” - I'd use more professional wording - Phrase “acceleration increasing difficulty of navigation” needs clearer structure or punctuation - Like I said earlier but Projects list tools but lack impact metrics - I'd add scale or results - Overall rlly good feel free to text me if u wanna call or something and chat more This looks good. I know you have some space at the bottom try and spread out the different projects/experiences. Not too much but right now it’s super crammed and harder to read this will also let you fill some of that white space.

Hi Nischal", "answers": "- contact information at thte top: try to shorten your linkedin llink. you dont need ur phone number either - i like your experience, but try and use that XYZ method I talked about last night - see if there is a way you can **quantify** your impact for the Inspirit one especially. maybe how many new functions you added, how much it increased the ability of the vehicle etc. for the AHN intern, I would include some info about how many patients you helped, numbers are super important. and for the english teacher role, I would also include how many students. - also for the Inspirit AI role, the role cna just be \"AI Intern\", not Inspirit AI Intern - that makes it redundant - add more info for the self driving car project, what technologies did you use - what algorithms?? what have you achieved - for the analyzing crime reports project, shorten that name - its too long - for the skills section, you dont need to have a bullet point if everything is one line - just put it as a block overall tho, pretty solid! @Srivats Pulumati hope this helps! - adding onto nij's comment about contact info: i'd also remove your location as well, not really necessary, imo, especially if you plan to apply to companies outside the pgh area - education section: don't use exact course names and use more general names that aren't specific to pitt e.g., \"Intermediate Programming using Java\" -> \"Intermediate Programming\" or \"Intermediate Java\" or \"Java Programming\" or sth similar I have a few small suggestions! - Just say “Expected Graduation Apr 2027” instead of the “2023 Aug - 2027 Apr”, I don’t think you need to have both in education section - For the dates, I think that month, year reads better than year, month - I think the projects should be in chronological order, so the most recent one at the top! - Is there a reason the skills isn’t formatted across the whole page? - Try to be consistent with adding periods in the descriptions, and I think you could add a little more detail to them! Overall, your experience is great! I think it’s pretty impressive 1. this is usually less verbose than the actual names and thus uses less space (e.g., \"Analytic Geometry and Calculus 3\" vs \"Calculus 3\") 2. you can't expect the reader to know what the class covers since not everyone is a pitt student like you, and the goal is for the reader to understand what you've learned - re: education dates, i kinda wanna push back against leaving out starting date cuz in my experience most places do ask for both start and end dates - and i agree, it's better to have Month Year rather than Year Month since the former is by far the most common date format used in the US - also 100% make sure your text formatting is consistent spelling, punctuation, etc if you wanna end bullet points with periods, make sure it's consistent across the whole document - if possible, i highly recommend separating out the skills by category, cuz rn it's just a hodge podge of very different skills some are programming languages, some are language packages, some are just general programming skills, and notepad++ is just a text editor - in \"Analyzing Crime reports from Pittsburgh Neighborhoods\", capitalize \"reports\" - in \"Pharmacist Shadowee/ Intern\", i'd remove the space after the slash to keep the spacing consistent - \"Self Driving\" -> \"Self-Driving\" - GPA: i'd put what the GPA is out of, if i were you, cuz not all schools have GPAs out of 4.0 so 3.7/4.0 - \"Bachelor of Science\" -> \"BS\", this is a standard abbreviation adding onto nij's comment about your linkedin link: go to your linkedin profile and customize your url to get rid of the spurious numbers I wouldnt do this A lot of effort and if youre applying to tech related positions, the requirements are pretty much the same wouldnt be worth the effort if you really wanna change your resume for diff positions, i'd say it's better to just keep a few variations for very broad types of positions rather than changing it up for every single application like a resume for frontend positions, one for backend, one for data science, etc Resume makes me happy"}

Oh lol gotcha Oh yeah I kinda see it now weird I feel like that generally frowned upon in a professional context?", "answers": "- You dont have to say anticipated graduation date, just put May 2028 - The spacing between the subsection and the bar is kinda off - Fix order of work experience - newest to oldest - Try to adhere more to google xyz format for descriptions I feel like the top isn’t centered XYZ format above for more meaningful bullet points Idt you need GitHub More bullet points could be good to get rid of white space I meant as a skill sorry I feel like it’s too far left Use your school email anyway I’ve heard the opposite idk as long as the personal email isnt something stupid like poopeater37@hotmail.com, it doesn't really matter whether you use a school or personal email. I use a personal one that is just for job apps and important things tho so I don't miss emails, whenever i used my school email things got more easily lost between all the other emails and garbage You should abbreviate the month names, so Sept. instead of September. Nawk Nawk also has a typo in Researched, and the date says “June Present”. Ryan’s advice is good. Otherwise looks good. Why do you say about the abbreviation It increases readability, makes it more concise and overall look better Same reason why LinkedIn doesn’t need to have the www, or even the .com honestly. A recruiter will understand in/name-here is a linked in url. Rlly good resume going into sophomore year +1 what was said above"}

The tensorflow image generator is for data augmentation. Which is standard and encouraged in ML/CV Synthetic data generation is an active area of research as well. Depends on the domain. that's fair, i don't know much about ml other than the class i took a few years ago lol 1) Linkedin link is broken (there's a ' ' character) 2) \"Relevant Coursework\" -> \"Coursework\" 3) Some of the things you have listed under frameworks are actually libraries (there is a difference). You can change frameworks to \"Frameworks & Libraries\" or make a new bullet just for libraries. 4) Weird place to list organizations. Maybe consider listing them under education section? Mastana is hype 5) The stats you use for your Nirvanaa Brows are kinda weird bc they would need to get updated every day. Do you have something more static? \"40% increase in online traffic within the first six months\" is much better 6) You can remove the AP scholar stuff or move it up to education section Overall looks pretty good. Bolding is a bit excessive."}

Currently planning on building a computer vision project soon, as well as a niche website/app. Also planning for AWS cloud certification.", "answers": "under the Skills header, you can probably remove the repeated Skills: text sup B) looks like you got some great experience. thought i'd give my two cents on some things you could improve since you want to make room for those other projects you mentioned: 1. the font and margins are really small. idk if this is lower than 10.5 but i've heard that that's the lowest you should go. as for margins, it wouldn't be that much of an issue, but the things is that i'd argue you don't need the extra space which i'll address below 2. you can save a ton of lines for things such as GPA, the massive gaps between each header and the first bullet, congregating the bottom 3 lines of ur TA description, eliminating new lines in paragraphs such as ur first bullet under Baans and 3rd under freudify (bc u have a whole line for one word) 3. skills has a header and a subheader titled skills 4. tartanhacks is 1 word not 2. i would add that it's at cnargie mellon university since that can help with ai resume readers bc cmu is good 5. i dont personally think adding \"USA\" at the end of each location is necessary so id remove it to save more space if needed. seeing as you have so much space in the middle of the page you could theoretically even put the dates next to the location 6. the header \"projects & outside experience\" ... i haven't seen \"outside experience\" ever used so i would say you could just say projects and go for a cleaner look 7. hyperlink the links in ur descriptions and underline them. 8. missing a space after \"MERN\" 9. don't put an end date for experiences that only last a month (ex. Feb2025-Feb2025 should be just Feb2025 imo) 10. remove extra tab before \"relevant courses\". optionally remove \"relevant\" and just say courses because it's supposed to be relevant anyway 11. you can either put the job title or the employer first in bold in each job description. however, if you choose to do this, it makes more sense to put ur TA and RA positions together under pitt, not 2 pitt job descriptions overall u have a lot of good descriptions but idrc abt that bc im better at the designing of resume stuff lol but hope this helped it seems u r doing rly well overall"}

Maybe \"smaller\"? 2) League of Legends bot 🤮 . jk jk. For some reason the vertical spacing between the baseline of \"League of Legends\" and the bullet point is different than the other projects. Not a big deal. 3) \"Programs\" bullet is a bit weird bc you include languages, software, cloud services, etc Overall I think it looks great! I don't really have too many suggestions. Once you don't consider yourself a \"newgrad\" anymore, I suggest bringing the education section to the bottom. 1-3 yoe. Idk if there’s a set number"}

Also if you’re gonna be doing another semester or two, don’t you think you should use school email? You could change it upon graduating lol Okok bet, nw then lol cracked resume no phone number? 4.000 is insane this dude cracked af I've said this before but ig it doesnt matter but the varity and spread of font sizes is a bit much but idt ur gonna change it lol you got rid of d1 diver Also pls upload image so bray doesn't have to download it LMAO my biggest pet peeve You should italicize the positions That’s what my resume does training llms @ Google btw Resume when My final nitpick: your email and LinkedIn are differently spaced compared to your email and Jan 2026 thing I feel like the research should be more bold, maybe as its own section as opposed to just thrown at the bottom of experience. What’s there right now barely calls attention to it NIT > LLM API's -> LLM APIs and capitalize openai, gemini, and bash I was thinking about having a research experience and professional experience section, then for SWE vs MLE roles, just move either one up for the role so also two different resume versions* i like the resume push to prod I noticed the experience section isn't totally chronological bc you grouped some pitt stuff together at the bottom, do you think that could get confusing or no?

{"text": "Utkarsh Tiwari: Resume Review Hi everyone, I made major changes to my resume. I'm posting the most latest version of it and asking for your reviews! I made changes based on suggestions by Jennifer Welton, SCI Director of Career Development. She has approved of this resume, and has promised to reply tomorrow with additional details. I am a first year student, with not much under my belt. She emailed me out of nowhere, saying my resume was a \"no bueno\" Game changer ❤️ Thanks, looking into it I had that in the beginning but Mrs. Welton had me make those white spaces between each heading. She was very persistent on them See that’s how it was, at some point, but she kept insisting there’s nothing wrong with two pages and that that was a past rule and isn’t applicable anymore. I like this version better. Thank you so much Jason! I’m aware of the fonts thing, is that necessarily a bad thing. I thought of it as having something different to look at for the recruiters. It’s different fonts but to my knowledge, it follows a pattern. For example, places are in italics and palatino, dates in TMR, etc. In Progress Did you make the font sizes smaller? can you give me the rundown im trying to bring it closer to yours This format How's this, except the font? I am afraid the line, underneath the headings, is too close to what follows Everything is Times New Romans I think this might be the best I can do: Thank you all guys!", "answers": "CSC ❤️ jenn I’d really start with some of the resources mentioned in https://discord.com/channels/729022532874797146/1284929155745447986 You have some good content but the format is a bit untraditional You might have also heard the advice of: “One page of résumé for every ten years of experience” basically, make it one page—you have plenty of vertical whitespace, so it should be doable without removing anything u can remove your highschool, it doesn't really matter tell her shes wrong or atleast have smaller whitespaces it feels like there is so much wasted space, can and should definitely be condensed Try and also be more consistent with formatting decisions, like some of the sections have a line under the header and some don't This fits all your experience on one page comfortably (though there are other formatting suggestions yet to be implemented) Also, you’re using four different fonts (Calibri, Cambria, Palatino, Times New Roman) i knew something with the fonts was off, but i couldn't tell what ngl if this is what Sci's official resume advice is like, thats a big RIP it hurt my eyes imo, was very confusing, having 1 or 2 fonts i think would keep it more consistent, and feel more organized put line to separate the personal contact info and education, and a Line under education as its the only heading without a line I agree, reduce the number of fonts and the suggestions about consistency are great too. You have at least one (presumed) typo, with “(203-2024)” for Steel City Codes, so just proofread everything to make sure > Taught 25 middle school students Wed Development typo > Managed to teach over 70 students basic programming and web development I think just taught again is better here > Helped get 3 guest speakers for the camp. Having many from different companies: Google, TCS, CGI! Would rephrase > AWS/Azure-IP, TensorFlow-IP, Mongo DB-IP, what does -IP signify? dont say in progress, either state it or don't if we are honest, you should always be in progress in learning skills Yeah closer to this format? or my own résumé oh—all I did for that was throw it into Inkscape and move and scale some stuff It wasn’t done in Word, but I can help in doing it [with Word] — decrease line spacing (maybe set it to 1.2) — decrease font size, especially headings (“Education”, “Professional Experience”, etc.) and your name — make sure horizontal lines are placed consistently — use right-aligned tabs for location and date — if you’re giving out paper résumés, consider writing out URLs and links to projects and organizations Are u able to reduce line spacing and whitespace more and increase font sizes a bit the small font combined with the whitespace makes me feel like i need to squint to read it also for consistency I'd Tab University of Pittsburgh at the top, as besides the headings, its more left than anything else How does this look? Attached is also the Word document, but because I use LibreOffice, there might be formatting differences. Obviously, go over and check if there are any problems with the file. Apologies that there are a number of things that aren’t “best practice” in the Word file, like using a small font size for spacing. I also forgot to remove the inconsistencies with the dates. You should, ideally, use an en-dash (–) `Unicode: U+2013` with no spaces to the left and right of it, like this: January–February 2023. Note that it is different from the hyphen `Unicode: 002D` this isnt bad i would keep the lines if possible, more distinct section then the small headings and no lines makes it feel harder to distinguish each section to me"}

Parsers have trouble with 2 columns (2) Remember to update your website with your new resume once you've finalized (3) Most people use bulletpoints for describing experiences & it is recommended bc it is easier to skim. I imagine you will have to switch over to bullets once you have a 1 column layout for space reasons. The actual language you've used here for describing your experiences is great, it says all of the right things... but recruiters are likely just going to skip it. Yeah I agree with Nathan also remove the “Software Engineering Intern”, don’t label yourself, let them decide for themselves"}
{"text": "Wabona Dandi Resume Review Hey y'all! I'm a senior, and interested in applying for swe and ds roles. Feel free to leave some productive feedback. Thanks in advance. Thanks Eric this is so helpful", "answers": "* The phone number is still the template version * Include link text for github and linkedin. The text can be a partial link: linkedin.com/in/wabonadandi * Include your GPA in the education section if it is >= 3.3 * Move skills section to the bottom of the page * Consider separating skills with commas instead of lines * Use past tense for your current work experience (it's better to have them all be consistent) * The advice is generally to have the jobs in chronological order, but I actually prefer leading with the most relevant work experience (your PNC internships). Consider moving the TA and IT Consultant positions to the end of the experience section, or even creating a second section (industry experience vs work experience or something like that). That's just my preference though. * \"Vastly improve students’ ability\" I don't like this, vastly improve is very subjective in this case. * \"Wrote the ”getIncidents” command\" Just briefly explain what it does rather than give the name in quotes -> \"wrote a script that queries incidents from the database and sends live updates in teams chat\" * For both the internships, state the tech stack you worked with. You only mention .NET. If you used C#, JS, or specific front end frameworks, mention them by name * Projects don't have job titles. Instead of saying \"Front End Developer\" under the projects, give the tech stack (BeatCode - JavaScript) * Link to project's live demo or code repository (if you're okay with a company looking at them) Looks good overall! It's a strong resume and the formatting is good. I agree with most of what Eric said, imo: 1. Make sure your margins equal on all sides (including top and bottom, rn you only have left and right), general rule of thumb is 0.5in on all sides 2. Instead of 'Programming Languages' I think you can just say 'Languages' 3. \"NOTABLE PROȷECTS\" => \"PROJECTS\" 4. \"LEADERSHIP AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\" => \"LEADERSHIP\" 5. Adding onto what Eric said about mentioning tech stack for internships, you can do even better i think and incorporate them in your bullet points, for example (hypothetical idk the system you worked on) \"Automated functionality of a settlement tool that assisted employees with settling debt with customer\" => \"Automated a settlement tool functionality for a Django RESTful API in Python that assisted employees with settling debt with customer\", then that way you can remove the last bullet point entirely (\" Leveraged Python, GraphQL, Django\") 6. (recommended) if you implement the heading style Eric talked about make it one line, it saves space I would say 5 doesnt just apply to internships, it applies to all your bullet points, look up the STAR, CAR, and XYZ format"}

Won't matter for GHC obviously you'll print the resumes out (right?). Also, your email is hyperlinked to your @pitt email, but the label is your gmail email. 2) Put comma: \"B.S Computer Science, Minor in Business\" 3) \"Languages\" and \"Tools\" should go in a \"Skills\" section instead of the \"Education\" section. \"Machine Learning\" and \"Natural Language Processing\" don't belong under \"Tools\". Is \"Front-End\" a language? 4) FACET lab is associated with the University so, \"FACET Lab - University of Pittsburgh\" would be correct. 5) \"Analyzed, and visualized\" remove \",\" 6) Idk why there are two bullets in your leadership section? I wouldn't do that unless I were planning on categorizing different leadership/involvement. A single list should be good. Also, if these are all University Affiliated, you may choose to put them in the education section. I'd recommend styling like this: \"ORGANIZATION (AFFILIATION)\". For example: \"Empowertech (Event Coordinator)\". Overall looks really good. The bullet points are good for all of your experiences. Switch your TITLE\\SUBTITLE for all of your experiences and projects (TITLE=Position name, SUBTITLE=Organization). Also, including location \"Pittsburgh, PA\" is probably not necessary & complicates the design. lmk what's blocking you from adding the other research to your resume.
