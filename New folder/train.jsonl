{"question": "Need Advice!!", "context": "Hey everyone, I recently got accepted to Pitt, but I’m struggling with a big decision and could really use some advice. I also got into Carlow University, and they gave me a financial offer that covers everything with some loans, plus I’d even get a $1,000 refund. Pitt, on the other hand, gave me an off-campus financial offer, which is cheaper overall, covers everything with loans, and gives me a $2,500 refund.

Now, my dilemma is that I want a peaceful and not-overwhelming college experience, and Carlow seems perfect for that since it’s a much smaller school.

So proud of your accomplishments already! You’ll shine wherever you end up!", "I happen to have direct knowledge about both of these programs, so I'm going to share my thoughts here. Hopefully some of this is helpful!\n\nYou're looking at two *very* different Computer Science programs, so there are a lot of factors to consider. Both programs have their strengths and weaknesses, so it can really come down to what exactly you're looking for in a program.\n\n**Pitt:**\n\nProgram size - Pitt's CS Program is definitely older and larger than Carlow's, which does carry some benefits such as a large alumni network and easier networking opportunities. The class sizes will definitely be larger than they would at Carlow, though that number will decrease as you start taking more upper-level courses in the major.\n\nHere are some exact numbers if you're curious: This semester, Algorithms &amp; Data Structures (an early course in the CS major) has 75 seats per section, as well as one section that has 150 seats in it. Intro to Data Science (a popular upper-level elective in the CS major) has 48 seats in each section.\n\nResearch - If you're looking to get involved in research, Pitt is an R1 research institution, so there are obviously a lot more opportunities there. However, one thing you'll find if you go to Pitt is that there are a lot of resources, but often you have to be the one to initiate contact. For research, for example, there's no central database of CS faculty who are looking for undergraduate students to help with research, so you need to be proactive and reach out to faculty you'd like to work with. That said, there are still a fair number of undergraduate CS students at Pitt who get involved in research.\n\nConnecting with Faculty/Students - The CS faculty at Pitt are great and really care about teaching. There are also a lot of resources available to you as a student both at Pitt and within the School of Computing and Information (SCI). However, if you want to make deeper connections with faculty, you'll need to put in some of the work yourself (for example, attending office hours, talking with faculty at events, etc.)\n\n**Carlow:**\n\nProgram size - Conversely, Carlow's CS Programs is new, so there are fewer resources to draw from. However, the flipside of that is that Carlow's CS classes are VERY small. (I'm talking less than 10 students for several of them) You will really get to know your CS faculty (since there are a lot fewer of them) and will find it much easier to get one-on-one attention from them.\n\nResearch - Carlow would have fewer opportunities in terms of research, but I also know that the faculty there are looking into research opportunities for their students to get involved with. So you'd have fewer options, but opportunities would still be there. I've also known students who attend Pitt but did research at CMU with CMU faculty, so the schools definitely do interact at times!\n\nConnecting with Faculty/Students - Small schools typically pride themselves on being really personal and having a lot of resources and support for their students. That is definitely true at Carlow. Just like at Pitt, the faculty are great and really care about teaching. In addition, as I mentioned, the class sizes are SMALL so you'll really get to know your classmates and your CS faculty will know you by name pretty quickly.\n\nCulture/Climate - You'll also want to take into consideration factors outside of the major itself. Carlow is a private Catholic institution. That doesn't mean it's hyper-religious or that you need to be Catholic to attend, but their history definitely informs their mission and goals, which impacts the culture on campus. This is not meant to be a negative point, though. I've heard really positive things about Carlow culture and climate!!\n\nMeanwhile, Pitt is a large public R1 research institution so, despite being just down the road in Oakland, the 'feel' of the two schools will probably be pretty different. Neither is better than the other necessarily, but the culture of each school will appeal to different students.\n\n  \n**PCHE:**\n\nAlso, both Pitt and Carlow are members of the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) which allows students enrolled at one school to take courses at another PCHE school during the fall/spring terms. So if you end up going to Carlow but there's a Pitt CS course you want to take that Carlow doesn't offer, you could always look into enrolling in the Pitt course through PCHE.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I hope some of this was helpful. Good luck with your decision-making! That sounds like a tough choice, but I'm sure either option will be great for you. It really just depends on what you're looking for in a program, since every student is going to prioritize things differently. There's no wrong choice! :)", "Always take the money, kid. I work with people from all different universities. \n\nDon’t let Pitt put you in debt. A scholarship is a big deal."]}

It’s top 100 but not top 50, depending on the year. Software development is a lucrative field but Pitt CS grads, for the most part, aren’t working for the same companies and commanding the same salaries that CMU ones, for comparison.\n\nMy advice is to wait and see what financial aid looks like but overall avoid going into more than ~70ish thousand in debt for an undergrad degree. If you don’t get financial aid to that end, I’d advise community college for a year or two to knock gen eds out, or look into programs that pay for your undergrad provided you work a specific role afterwards. \n\nDespite taking a number of master’s level classes here (1510, 1511, 1622, and 1678) I haven’t seen anything someone couldn’t teach themselves from free (especially if you’re willing to sail the seven seas) online material. The knowledge itself is not what you’re paying for for an undergrad degree in CS. Undergrad computer science curricula are generally the same, from public schools like Pitt to elite schools like CMU— you’ll take two or three semesters of discrete math and probability, three or four semesters of programming/data structures and algorithms, two or three semesters of computer architecture and operating systems, and a variety of upper-levels that you can tailor to your interests after all those.

A scholarship to bring the cost down to in-state levels, plus the Pell and match would bring your costs down to &lt;15k per year, housing and dining included.\n\nAlso, as a CS student, look into [CSC at Pitt](https://pittcsc.org). And also (and don’t bet on this, but keep it in mind), if you are a very passionate, driven, and especially charismatic person, high-paying internships and later a career in big tech is not out of the picture, especially if you utilize resources like CSC.

I’ve been reading a lot of debates of CS0007 vs CS401 and I am struggling on deciding what to take. For some background my high school offered programming courses mainly in C# and one in JavaScript. I took all of these courses and passed just fine. I don’t have that much real concrete experience with JavaScript and was wondering if someone who took it would be able to tell me a little about it and whether or not it’s okay to enroll without prior experience in JavaScript.

The courses must appear in the list of approved courses for engineering students.\n\nAP credits were never as useful as my high school teachers advertised. Maybe things have changed since my teachers graduated and colleges realized that accepting so many AP credits lets them rake in less money from tuition. I only used credits for humanities and social sciences and retook calc 1, physics 1&amp;2, etc, that I already took in high school just to boost my GPA.", "They want engineering students to actually take some college level gen Ed/humanities courses in college to be more well rounded, that’s why they cap the number of non-STEM APs accepted.

For example I know they don’t give credit for AP stat at all. I got a 5 on that exam and feel like I learned more in the first half of the first stat class I took in Swanson than I did in all of AP statistics. It was definitely not equivalent to a whole college level engineering statistics course in depth, nor was it specifically tailored for engineering applications. \n\nThey won’t give you credit for a geology course because those classes don’t count toward a degree in the engineering school.

They do impact your GPA.\n\nIn general though AP classes aren’t nearly as widely accepted for credit/degree progress than they were 20 years ago, probably because now most kids take them either to look better on college apps or because they want a more challenging/in depth course so colleges can get away with giving out fewer credits.", "Swanson is ABET accredited, which is why the curriculum rules are so strict.

I also got credit for Bio 1 and 2, Phys 0174, Geol 0840, etc. I will say that Phys 0175 deviated from the content I learnt for the e&amp;m exam, especially towards the end of the course (Snell's law, for instance). \n\nBefore I transferred away from engineering, my Swanson advisor told me that stat credit isn't awarded because Stat 1000 is not a required course for engineering. This probably holds true for the rest of the AP exams not accepted; they simply aren't prereqs for any engineering path (though I don't know why APs such as Music Theory are accepted). \n\nI would definitely use any AP credits you can.

I'm a computer science major, but don't want to take it if it's for nothing.", "answers": ["I'm getting the certificate and also a CS student. It's a nice way to get a more rounded tech education imo since IS is more focused on the business and planning side of things and less on straight coding. There's also a ton of overlap between CS courses and IS courses, so if you are decently far in your CS path, it will make the IS classes fairly easy. \n\nAs for how useful it is, I guess it depends what you want to do. I like it because it helps me understand more of the big picture for things like why what you are programming is even worth making, how it fits into the larger systems, etc. It also eased me into the harder CS electives (like taking IS Databases helped with CS Data Science for example). So it's really up to if that sounds like it's up your alley. \n\nOn the downside, depending on how far along you are, it takes up a lot of your course load. I didn't start on it until after studying abroad, so my whole senior year has literally just been back to back CS and INFSCI classes with no other subjects, which can burn you out if you're someone like me who wants to sprinkle in non techy classes. I also feel like jobs care less about certificates than minors, but I also don't think either really matter as long as you can demonstrate what you know.

I am of the opinion that, although CS 445/1501 are canonically most important for coding interviews &amp; such, 441 is additionally one of the most important classes as a CS major. You can memorize algorithms all you want, but really understanding them requires some understanding of discrete math. Sometimes my memory of 441 would make or break my level of understanding during a 1501 lecture or in some upper-level classes.\n\nThat tangent aside, 441 and 445 don't really overlap, since 441 is all math. I took them both during spring of freshman year, and imo that's the best way to do it. If you must take them in different semesters, take 445 closer to when you take 1501, as that content more directly transfers over.", "you will build upon your knowledge from 445 in 1501. nothing u learn in 441 is relevant for 1501", "As a fellow CS minor, I took 441 a semester before 445 (what I’m taking currently). My 445 professor, Hoffman, has used some of the vocabulary and a few concepts from 441 like Union, Intersection, XOR, difference, and so on. Having the prior knowledge and vocabulary under my belt helped me understand quicker and easier. So if you have no preference/restrictions then take 441 either before or during the semester you take 445.

You can do a quick Google of all the programs and do the quick arithmetic and see that it is thousands of people a year getting these degrees as opposed to maybe a few hundred Masters in Statistics and Mathematics.\n\nI would say if you have 5 plus years of experience as a data scientist or data analyst and want to use the program to refine some skills and maybe move up a job title or position it is a good use of your time. If you want to use it to pivot into the industry and have no experience you need a traditional masters especially if you don’t have a STEM degree.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that many data science and data analyst roles see hundreds if not thousands of applicants per positions and most companies use an algorithm screening process which means if you don’t fit a certain criteria you probably aren’t even getting your resume looked at.\n\nHope this helps!

Both of us had 800+ credit scores and almost no other debt apart from the student loans.\n\nThe consequences of this debt can last for decades.

Anyone on this path?\n\nThank you!", "answers": ["Hey. DNID is still a bit new so it's a little bit thrown together still, but everyone involved seems very enthusiastic about it. I declared DNID last major after CS didn't work out for me. I'd probably recommend that. My plan of course is to still get a job in software engineering, because I love writing code and have work experience doing that and a portfolio. I think you get out of the major what you want to. Let me know if you have any other questions", "I just finished my first year here at Pitt, and DNID is great... when you can actually get classes. If you look at the major page, you'll see there's a couple categories with requirements you have to fulfill before you can select a track and complete that. Unfortunately, I have had a criminally difficult time being able to fulfill any of those requirements.\n\nFirst semester, I was able to get the Media Literacy and Programming Basis requirements done, but only because my advisor got me into an academic community that reserved seats in those classes.\n\nSecond semester (just completed), since I didn't have the academic community to help me out, I was only able to get Intermediate Programming. The silver lining is that this allowed me to fulfill a lot of gen eds as well as sample some of the tracks (if the class has no prerequisites, there's nothing stopping you from taking it, so I took Intro to Fiction Writing to try to get a sense of the Game Design track), but I really would've liked to take the classes I'm supposed to be taking, y'know?\n\nMost recently, I tried to pick classes for first semester of next year. My enrollment date was Monday morning, so I made a tentative schedule on Friday, assuming I might have to change it a little bit as things filled up. On Sunday night, 3 of the 6 classes I had put in my cart were full. Frustrating, but good thing I checked, so I took an hour or two and made a new schedule. All good, right? Wrong. In the less than 12 hours that separated me doing that from my enrollment opening the next morning, 4 of the 6 had filled up. All in all, I tried to take 11 different classes and got 2, neither of which were in my major. I'm still not sure what I'm taking next semester.\n\n**WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID**\n\nThe classes within the major themselves have not missed. Last semester, Into to New Media with Prof. Koob was terrific and my Intro to Programming with Prof. Sherbinin was a good class if not super interesting (YMMV, I already knew Python from high school so I was tuned out most of the time, but if you're new to programming she def knows what she's talking about). This semester, Intermediate Programming with Prof. Ferreira was great and Intro to Fiction Writing with Prof. Sachdeva was a good class, although it ultimately wasn't for me.\n\nAdditionally, DNID makes it really easy to pick up a CS minor along the way if that's something you're interested in. Basically take the right programming classes in the DNID major and add like two data science classes and you've got a CS minor, which is what I'm doing.\n\nSo basically, be prepared to take a LOT of gen eds your first (and maybe even second ://) year (or consider double minoring—I picked up a music minor alongside the CS one and I'm working on that + gen eds until I can get into DNID classes), but if you can stand that, the major itself has been really great so far. Hope this helps!", "Forgot to mention, out of the 3 tracks I found on the website, I’m leaning more towards the game design :)"]}

There’s plenty of resources and plenty of places that hire interns. I found my 2 internships for sophomore year (this year for me) on Handshake in my field (health services/public health) but I’ve had friends who are data science and have internships too. I’m born and raised in Boston and unfortunately I didn’t get into northeastern but I remember when I was a senior I was really drawn to their co-ops too but truthfully pitt has a vibe that I like better and was still able to get good career exploration opportunities as just a sophomore. It’s ultimately up to you but I’m a testament that you can definitely find multiple internships throughout your time here! Also I love how Oakland comes alive when the weather is nice. It’s nice to be in a bustling small college town when everyone is a student but both my internships allowed me to work downtown and in other parts of Allegheny County. Good luck with your decisions!", "I can’t speak to Northeastern, but I graduated from Pitt in 2023 and still live in the city. Qualifying this with the fact that I’m from NJ and always envisioned myself returning to a big east coast city. Pitt is WONDERFUL. \n\nCAMPUS: imo it’s near-perfect. Urban, but still with some big green spaces. In the middle of the city but still has a very campus feel - the quad complex is huge, and many areas around campus that give a college atmosphere (aka not just a bunch of buildings in the middle of the city). Think all the benefits of a campus like NYU or GW, but with many of the perks of a more defined campus. Campus runs along the parallel Fifth &amp; Forbes Aves, where *so many* bus lines run to downtown &amp; around the city, and your free bus pass is tied to your student ID. Many many food options, coffee shops as well as study spaces across campus. The Cathedral of Learning (Cathy) is gorgeous, and if you value having majestic spaces to study or attend class in, bingo (the other buildings vary in quality and majesty greatly I will say). \n\nSIZE: classes are roughly 4,500 students. That means you’ll never meet everyone, and there are spaces/groups for anyone. There are so many clubs and I found it was the best way to make friends - small clubs especially. I’m not sure how many CS students there tend to be, but I know my CS friends found community within their major. I loved the size of the school because you always run into people but you can always meet so many more. \n\nCOMMUNITY &amp; SOCIAL/PARTY SCENE: Again, clubs are great. So are sports if that’s your thing - football is huge here, basketball also has a very big culture. Amazing game day energy on campus and at games. The big school pride was very fun to be a part of. As for nighttime fun, Greek culture is a big part of Pitt, but not so big that the social scene is dependent on it. There’s also a stem-focused social frat if that’s your thing, as well as academic Greek life orgs. It can feel intimidating at such a big school, but you can make friends in any way and Pitt offers so many opportunities to meet new people. \n\nPROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES: Being in a huge class means lots of opportunities - internships and companies to network with, professors to develop relationships with, and the student body network itself. I can’t speak to CS, but like other commenters noted, your competition would be mostly classmates and CMU students across a metro area with over one million people. The city population has begun to (slightly) increase after being on the downturn for a long time. Pgh feels like a well-kept secret compared to many on the east coast, and the job market will hopefully grow as the city does. \n\nPITTSBURGH: Man, I really fell in love with this city. Oakland is smack in the middle, so most places are a 10 minute drive or 20-30 min bus ride max. The Peterson Events Center (home to the enormous gym, food court and basketball arena) is a concert venue for lots of musical artists - and if they don’t go to the Pete, they’ll likely be at PPG (downtown penguins arena) or Stage AE nearby. Pittsburgh has over 400 bridges going across its rivers and the views are stunning. As for cost of living, your friends in Boston, NYC, Philly etc will be shocked when they hear how much you’re paying in rent (in and around oakland is often $700-900 with roommates and $1k ish living alone). \n\nI’m definitely missing plenty of things, but I’d really encourage you to visit if you’re able. Visiting is what really convinced me. Best of luck with your decision, hope this was helpful!", "If you contact the admissions office they can connect you with a student ambassador for your major!", "You can find internships and jobs out of any big, reputable school like Pitt or Northeastern. It’s all gonna be about building a resume and networking/who you know. Career departments and fairs can help, but both schools are about equal when it comes to all that.\n\nI’ve been on both campuses (graduated from Pitt but visited friends at Northeastern many times), know people who had great experiences at both, and know both of them are well regarded for the program you’re looking at. I don’t think you can go wrong.\n\nGo on whatever your gut is telling you and strongly consider whatever the cheaper option is if you’re looking at taking out loans. Monthly payments are no joke.", "I was in-state so Northeastern was not worth the price when I had to decide 6 years ago. I also wanted to cross enroll at CMU. \n\nAfter graduating, the CS club at Pitt turned out to be the main reason why I enjoyed my experience here. Now, they are the school’s biggest org. We also went viral in the tech world for our internship repo. The community led me get offers and interviews from apple, msft, bloomberg, etc. After graduating, I ended up at a Series A startup. \n\nWith that said, I bet you could get the same outcome at Northeastern. It was really about the relationships you make at these schools and what you make of it.\n\nDef check them out on IG @csc.at.pitt\n\nOne thing tho, we have a relatively young CS program. The upcoming guest commencement speaker is your average joe software engineer AFAIK but there’s nothing wrong with that. In an ideal world I would’ve picked Adam Sandler", "Pitt, all day. Easy. If you’re in Boston applying to internships, you can easily be overlooked for students like you that attend Harvard, MIT, BU, Boston College, etc. If you’re in Pittsburgh, you only have to worry about CMU students stealing your opportunities."]}

CS at Pitt is in its own school (Computing/Information). This is similar to other institutions (CMU does this) in order to make the application pool more rigorous and to up the prestige factor. The CS majors that I’ve met have been able to land internships and offers at startups, big name firms, and regional employers. A lot of effort is on the student so it is what you put into the process. If you apply as a CS major to Pitt, I’d recommend a 1400, or go test optional. Fortunately for you, Pitt is allowing test optional for a few more cycles so this would benefit you tremendously unless you score in the upper 20% of their range. I would highly recommend applying right when the admissions cycle opens (August 1st) since Pitt is rolling and it will give you the best shot. You should also consider applying to Dietrich undecided and transfer once you’re in, in order to up your chances.

Between the two, I would choose Pitt.", "I can give some experience with the overall learning experiences at both universities.Pitt is gonna be a lot more learning on your own as classes can be fairly large at times so you will not know your professor on a very personal level in most cases unless you are proactive in visiting office hours (etc). While as at Duquesne the classes are much smaller and you will be around a lot of people in your major across all your courses so that creates an easier time to get acquainted with a few folks to help with the work (etc) also you will be a lot more familiar with your professor as they are smaller classes. Duquesne education is a lot more hands on and catered to the students more than Pitt I would say,but Pitt has a bigger name on reputation which in my opinion carries you a lot further than just the education itself as the job markets become more competitive where you went to school is more important than ever. These are just some things to keep in mind best of luck!", "Duquesne's CS program is silly. You'd have just as much value getting a CS degree from a community college or online program. If you want to study CS, do not go to Duquesne. In the eyes of hiring managers, it has literally no signal.

Get that SAT up, and go for Pitt. Pitt CS is annoying and you’ll be grinding your ass off, so make sure you have a good work ethic. \n\nAnd the next part of my advice applies to Pitt CS for sure but probably also Duquesne and a lot of colleges CS-wise. I cannot emphasize this enough… practice learning on your own. A lot the good CS professors only teach lower level CS courses.

I ended my undergraduate career in Pitt physics with a GPA of about a 3.5, and I certainly do not think of myself as smart or any kind of genius which is why I say it’s achievable. \n\nThere are classes within the course lineup that are hard for sure, for me it was intro to modern physics, intermediate EM, and Quantum 2. However, the classes you mentioned specifically have good professors (as far as I know) and tend to actually be easier than anticipated.\n\nI would say the best way (after a few years and many mistakes) to do well in the department is to work with others. The people who graduated with me helped me immensely both on homework’s and studying but also as motivation since those people were there in the exact same position as me. \n\nI think the last piece of advice I have is to be cautious of the first few semesters. College is immensely different than high school, it’s certainly fun and it’s an experience which is 100% going to shape you as a person, but it will challenge you a lot along the way. It’s easy to get caught up in the social aspect of college and get distracted, make sure you understand concepts, take classes seriously, go to office hours if need be. The first few semesters set you up for the final ones. A good GPA from freshman year can really help to pad the difficult classes (which is of course helped by gen ed classes, pick easy/interesting gen eds, don’t make life harder than it needs to be). \n\nJust to cover my bases: That previous paragraph is not to say you shouldn’t be taking time to participate in the fun college activities, I did and I wouldn’t take back a moment of it (work life balance is extremely important!), it’s just advice I wish I took more seriously as a freshman when the classes were easier.\n\nFinally, don’t ever call it UPitt, people will make fun of you (as you can see from nearly every response to this).\n\nP.S. if you’d like to talk more about majoring in physics here, you’re more than welcome to PM me", "Bro it’s Pitt not upitt", "I a currently a physics major and got a B in AP physics 2 in high school.

{"question": "computational biology + premed", "context": "Hi yall!\n\nI’m a HS senior who got into SCI for cs but recently shadowed some doctors and found an interest in medicine. I still love cs but I was wondering how difficult it would be to pursue comp bio in SCI with the intention of applying to med school, and would anyone recommend doing this path?\n\nThanks!", "answers": ["Hello! I’m a Pitt grad, who got their degree in comp bio. I commented about this on another post- most people I know who were senior premeds would not do it again. There are a few exceptions 1. You want to go into a niche fellowship after residency and become a clinical informatician, 2. You do an MD/PhD In comp bio or CS, 3. You think of another way to incorporate CS into medicine that is a substantial part of your career (I’m in a PhD program in a med school I can tell you the regular MD does not use medicine in their daily routine/ even specialists etc). So the reason for this is that you essentially want to minimize the number of gap years you take between undergrad and med school. It’s going to be hard for a couple of reasons. 1. There are about 6ish extra classes you will need to take that are not premed, 2. The Bio department has a bit of grade inflation imo due to grade grubbing , but the CS department is very straightforward. Your classes are project based your code/proof works or it doesn’t, not really a ton of partial credit and ECs honestly take forever! You need to dedicate a lot of time in a different way than you would a bio major. 3. due to this pretty intense course load doing your extra curriculars like clinicals, research, volunteering, clubs are going to be hard to balance with the sit down time needed for CS coursework. I was a TA, I was doing research, I was in clubs, and I was very stressed during the semesters. I didnt even have all those clinical hours/other pre med activities. Lastly if you decide you want to be a clinical informatician or any of the paths above, honestly I think you need some extra classes to be a GOOD computational biologist and I have suggested them to advising many times over because they are actually crucial for the field (ML, linear algebra, genomics, databases). That being said, I would do the regular pre med schedule and then your freshman spring you will have bio2/chem2/cs11. Evaluate how you do, and if you are okay with something similar (maybe more intense) over the next 3 years."]}
{"question": "Comparing CompBio Undergraduate Majors", "context": "I'm a high school senior considering applying for the CompBio undergraduate major at Pitt. I have a few questions and would greatly appreciate any insights you can share from your experiences:\n\na. For those who have been part of the CompBio major through either Dietrich School or SCI, did you notice a significant overlap in classes and resources (professors, labs, etc) between the two? \n\nb. If you have thoughts or information about both programs, could you share how they compare? Are there distinct advantages or unique experiences that one offers over the other, such as faculty expertise and research opportunities?\n\nc. I've heard about potential collaborations between Pitt and CMU. Does Pitt offer any joint classes with CMU, especially in the CompBio or CS fields? Additionally, is it feasible for Pitt students to take CS courses at CMU?\n\n As I am also considering a future application to medical school, I would greatly appreciate any insights through this lens as well.  \n\nAnd any additional advice or experiences you can share would be invaluable as I make my college decision. Thank you in advance for your help and time!", "answers": ["Hey! I'm currently a junior CompBio major in the SCI School!\n\n1.) Classes: As far as classes go, all of your major cores and classes will be essentially the same in both schools. The only place you will see a diffence is in  your first year seminar and gen eds. Each school has different gen ed requirements, the categories aren't too different but and most classes fulfill requirements in both schools so its not too bad. I have noticed that SCI seemingly has more gen ed options since their requirements are more broad. As far as overlap goes, theres really not much, especially at the beginning. You'll have a lot of different classes in different science deparments, (chemistry, math etc) but as you progress there becomes much more overlap in content and you see a lot more of the \"CompBio\" cross-section\n\nResources: Since theyre different schools, you'll probably see the most stark difference in resources. In Dietrich, since the school is pretty big you don't have the same academic advisor each semester, SCI is a little smaller so you're guaranteed the same advisor for all of undergrad. You'll also get reserved seats for certain classes in your school. Both schools run different events and have different departments, so there might be more differences to research but in general the resources are just more CS centered: You'll get emails about tech events/internships and probably work more closely with people in that field\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) I don't actually know anyone taking CompBio in Dietrich, but as I mentioned above, the resources and the type of people you want to work with would help determine which school is best for you. In general, the Dietrich school is less personalized but if you want to explore the natural sciences/biology more, theres more wiggle room there. SCI is slightly more personalized, but you'll be exposed to much more of the CS and tech side of things. You said you're considering medical school, and in that case I might give a point to Dietrich. Both are good, but it depends on what you want out of the experience as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.) You can! I haven't done it peronally, but CMU has a program where you can do cross-registration with them for 1 course a semester while you're at Pitt, or some other Pittsburgh schools as well. I'm not sure what kinds of classes they'd have avaliable, but I've heard they have a great CS department so you might be in luck there.\n\nNote: Since SCI is more of \"specialized\" school, it's also a little harder to get into, and slighty more competitive. If by the end you're still not sure which one you want, I'd recommend just going for the SCI school, since its much eaiser to transfer from SCI to Dietrich and not the other way around. However, if you are in one school it is possible to work with departments from the other, depending on what you wanna do!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps!", "Hey!\n\nI am a Computational Biology postdoc in Dietrich who teaches computational biology classes and does research with Dr. Jacob Durrant. I did my PhD in Chemical Engineering at Pitt and have taken classes at CMU. I started my postdoc during the summer so I am still learning as much as possible, but here are my thoughts.\n\n**a.** I concur with /u/No_Ad2431 here. I'll add that the one major difference is your capstone course for your degree. If you are in Dietrich then you take the Comp Bio capstone and the CS capstone if you are in SCI. You can imagine how different this would be.\n\nIn terms of resources, you have access to pretty much any resource at Pitt. The main difference is what email lists you get added to. Research labs are not restricted to which school, or even department, you are in. It just changes the probability of you randomly running into faculty. Most comp bio researchers are actually from the Computational and Systems Biology department in the medical school. (The department does not have an undergraduate program.) There are a couple in the Department of Biological Sciences (e.g., Dr. Durrant) but I'm not aware of prominent ones in CS but I could be wrong.\n\n**b.** I concur with /u/No_Ad2431 here. See my above response as well. One piece of advice I heard was that Dietrich's tuition is cheaper. So some students will start Dietrich and then switch to SCI to minimize tuition. If you are considering medical school, I would also add a point to Dietrich.\n\n**c.** Students can cross-register for CMU classes. When looking at the comp bio department at CMU they are mainly focused on algorithm development. Which is great if you want to get into that area. I will say that CS classes at CMU are top-notch, and thus can get very intense but you will learn a tremendous amount.\n\nSome other general advice is that if you want to do computational biology as a career, you will most likely need to do at least an MS or preferably a PhD. Most of the undergraduate students I have talked to are either applying to PhD programs or seeking data science/CS jobs.\n\nFor medical school, I have no idea. I know many people who are in or finished medical school. None of them majored or were interested in comp bio. Medical school admissions have changed since I was finishing undergrad, so I'm not sure if majoring in comp bio would substantially help. If anyone has insight into this I would love to hear it.\n\nFeel free to ask me any other questions!", "Hello! I think the other two users sufficiently answered your questions, but I wanted to give you some advice about somethings I noticed with comp bio premeds. I’m a graduated comp bio major, I was not premed, however a fair amount of students were. During my senior seminar class, a lot of them mentioned that if they chose again they would not do it. 1. Some of the premed requirements are not in the major, so you have to make room for it outside the major instead of making more room in the schedule for minors and certificates. 2. Treating CS classes like a second priority, if you are going to med school it may feel like the CS classes come second to your bio requirements. The CS classes are fairly hard for people who have made CS their priority. This kind of results in poor CS grades which drops your GPA (source: my advisor who said this happened all the time). 3. The classes are project based, your code works or it doesn’t. There’s really no salvageable partial credit. This means you need a big chunk of time to sit down and do it. Most of the premed requirements are study based, and study time is flexible to schedule. This is an issue if you are trying to fit in a lot of the components suggested for med school like research, volunteering at the hospital, TA duties, and clubs. I was a TA and I did research, I ended up going my PhD, and my courseload was really overwhelming at times especially in my junior and senior years. I think there is a case in which it is worth it, try CS 011 see if it is your passion. If you see yourself using CS in medicine like doing an MD/PhD, do it. However if you are doing it to stand out, it’s probably going to be very difficult to acquire skills that you may not use again."]}

That is not what this school is for. It is for medical related majors, business, and engineering. Don't believe course offerings they list online for math and CS.

I do have a friend who is getting permission to take a grad level class next semester but he has a really good relationship with that professor and has performed extremely well in his classes multiple times so he’s an outlier.", "The closest you get to \"high/low level\" classes is regular and honors classes. But generally, there's not that many honors classes, so there's just one class for each class. If you want to be \"accelerated\" then you'd have to do it yourself by scheduling max credits each semester (18, usually 6 classes). You can take some graduate classes but I think you have to get permission for them", "I went to the career fair for CS this fall and there was no big tech presence at all. Companies like Deloitte, PNC, Epic, DSG etc will show up, and a bunch of smaller local companies. 2023 has been awful for tech in general, but the career fair really just felt useless this year.\n\nThere's a couple AI/ML electives that seem interesting, and I am taking several next semester, but nothing that interesting at all otherwise IMHO. Lots of very surface-level courses like Software QA, DBMS etc are offered, but having taken some they are not very comprehensive nor intensive. You can take a CMU class only if there's no analogue offered at Pitt. You can also take (1) grad course throughout your undergrad years. A lot of semesters, there's only a handful of upper-level CS electives you can even pick from. Many are only available in either the spring or fall. \n\nI can only speak for CS, but Pitt's CS department is lacking pretty heavy for undergrads and there's lots of turnover in advising and for professors. Funnily enough, a lot of course content is just ripped from CMU. \n\nWe're still pretty well ranked for CS (somehow), but if you truly want success from Pitt as a CS major you absolutely have to do a lot of work on your own behalf (networking, projects, etc). Obviously the job market can and will probably change in the next four years, but while still considering the price of tuition even in-state I am pretty disappointed.

{"question": "Transferring Out", "context": "I was planning to transfer out by the spring of 2024, but I was accepted to one of my target schools so I decided to get out earlier. I want to share my experience at Pitt and comment on it, so this post will be very subjective. ( you do not have to see a post that will make you feel uncomfortable)\n\nI liked Pitt very much when I arrived here, I met some nice people and some of them guided me to my dorm when I got lost on the campus. The first day of class was great, the professor I had in my math class during my first year is still one of the best lecturers I have met at Pitt. I thought I am going to spend all four years here at Pitt.\n\nHowever, as I was studying at Pitt, I found some of the professors did not know how to teach a class ( they could be very helpful but their lectures are very ambiguous and I had to spend a ton of extra time for their classes), I was wondering how did Pitt recruit one of my Professors when I attended his almost \"trash\" lecture. and if you want to work with a \"good\" professor, you have to rush for their class at the very beginning of the enrollment period because the spot is limited and everybody wants to enroll in their classes to get a better grade.\n\n some of them were too strict on grading (one of my intro-level gen-classes had an average grade of D) that were almost unnecessary. \n\nI have something to say about TAs, most of them are helpful, and some of them could be pretty caring which I am very thankful for. However, they could grade you super harshly. The average for my Calculus 1 final was around 60 after the curve, and a professor in the math department told me the TAs would not give points for your steps if your steps or result is very different than the solution, and she thought this to be very unfair for the students who could get a better grade if the TAs could spend more time on checking the answers.  One of my friends told me his TA gave him a grade of 63 on one of his exams in a biology class, and when he went to ask for a regrade from the professor his grade changed to 89.\n\nI like the students at Pitt very much because Pitt is all very friendly and energetic, I can always meet some friendly guys to say hi to me when I am walking around the campus, which really made my day. But some of them are strange, they would prank you for no reason and their pranks could be very offensive, but they seem to not realize this. Also, some of the Pitt students are selfish as fk that they will have parties in the final weeks in resident halls at midnight when most of the others were trying to get a good sleep or studying for their exams. I had one guy who yelled in the hallway around 2 a.m.    \n in a day on the final week. Also, it is very painful to drive a car through the road between William Pitt Union and Cathy because some of the students won't give a fk about the drivers.\n\nLastly, I have to say I hate all the constructions here, they did not make my life at Pitt better but rather made it worse\n\nSuggestions (if you want): if you are a freshman who is seeking to transfer out in your future terms, then I would suggest you attend other colleges because Pitt is very rigorous in its grading and there is no GPA inflation here.\n\nClass&amp;Profs that I would suggest( if you want):\n\nEngCmp with Professor Cristina D' Imperial ( easy grading &amp; flexible due dates &amp; caring)\n\nAny math class with Dr. Hockensmith ( guaranteed A in even Calculus 3&amp; super accessible&amp; flexible due date&amp; clear lecture structures&amp; a ton of extra credits&amp; notes and recordings of lectures are posted online)\n\nIntro to Film with Dr. Heinzel ( easy A &amp; nice prof &amp; flexible due dates )\n\nGerman Saga with Dr. Uwe Stender (easy A &amp; nice prof &amp; enjoyable lecture)\n\nCS class with Professor Stephen Ellies (The best prof in the CS department)\n\nSummer math class with Professor Hauptman ( Super caring &amp; easy A &amp; flexible due dates)\n\nSwedish class with Professor Eva Albertson ( Fun class &amp; caring professor &amp; fair grading)\n\nStudy place that I would suggest ( if you want):\n\nFrick Fine Art Library\n\nThackeray hall room 624\n\nThanks for reading my post.\n\nHail to Pitt!", "answers": ["These are common issues at any university.

{"question": "Questions from Prospective Student", "context": "Hello all! I'm a rising senior looking to apply to Pitt next year for either CS/Math. The school looks awesome but I wanted to hear from people there. \n\n1. How is Pittsburgh as a city, internship/things to do wise? Do you feel safe? \n2. Does being near CMU overshadow the school or help the school? \n3. How are class sizes? Are professors generally good? \n4. How hard are classes generally? How suitable is double majoring? I'm trying for academia so I wouldn't mind some inflation\n\nThanks!", "answers": ["1. I think Pittsburgh is very safe. I'm from the Philly area so comparatively it's safe. Still be aware of your surroundings but I never felt like I was in direct danger of anything.\n\n2. CMU and Pitt are almost separate entities. Our campuses are far enough away I've really never interacted with CMU students. We can take CMU classes but I never have. CMU's campus I think is also a little lower than ours street wise.\n\n3. Profs range from great to terrible. It mainly comes down to the department from what I can tell. Overall though there's not a lot of grade deflation/inflation except in specific majors. Almost all intro classes will be 50-100 students with recitations around 20-30. However, upper levels and some more obscure classes can have as little as 10-15.\n\n4. Depends on what you're double majoring in and if it's in the same school. Pitt doesn't have grade inflation or deflation imo. The classes are fair for the most part and if they are harder many profs will grade on a curve in either individual tests or overall grade.", "I agree completely with everything that's been mentioned, but I'll give you my answers too so you have more opinions to work with. \n1. Pitt is great as a city for internships and stuff to do. You can get downtown easily with the busses (which we get for free with pitt ID) so there's a bunch to explore. And I've never felt unsafe on Pitts campus, no matter what time it is there's always a bunch of college kids walking somewhere so that helps you feel safe. Plus if you're in Oakland I feel like I see police patrols pretty often. I will say tho, pitt has recently been having problems with the emergency alert system but hopefully that will get fixed by the fall.\n2. I've never once felt any sort of relation to CMU, positive or negative. I've heard profs sometimes talk about how you can go to their library if you need a place to study but that's it honestly. \n3. Class sizes are completely dependant on the course. I've taken Russian Fairytales with 300 people and I've taken a bunch with like 25-30 as well as a specific lab with like 15. Professors are also generally good from my experience. There are ofc great and terrible professors but that's the same anywhere, just use ratemyprofessor whenever you can. \n4. Again, class difficulty greatly depends on the course. I'm not in stem so I can't speak for that but all of my gen eds have felt very fair. None of them felt unrealistic with the work/expectations. And honestly it really is what you put in, I didn't study at all in highschool and it worked for me. Now I just study like once a night for a week before the test and I'm good. You just have to hold yourself accountable. \n\nAs for more general pitt things, there's a bunch of construction all over right now which isn't amazing. The dining hall food is also not the best but there's a ton of places around that take dining dollars so its not a big deal. Socially, if you don't try you're not gonna make friends, unless you're in a very specific degree path that everyone has to strictly follow. There's so many classes that you won't really take the same classes as people you know unless you plan it, so you won't really be making friends with classmates like you would in highschool by being in class with them all the time. But there's a ton of clubs and stuff to meet people in so. \n\nOverall, pitt is a great school as long as you make it work for you. Find the classes you're interested in, find clubs you're interested in, and make your schedule as carefully as you can and it'll be a breeze."]}

The further I get in CS, the more I go to office hours, professors and TAs are super helpful, they’ll even help you debug! Just bring specific questions to ask and tell them what you have have tried already and where you think the errors are. It’s also completely okay to go and ask how to even begin a project. I remember wrapping my head around a blackjack game we had to make was overwhelming, they can help you get started!\n\nDepending on who you took 401 with they might not have covered topics to the depth Ramirez expects you to know. Go to Ramirez’s 401 website and look at/listen to lecture slides to brush up if you can.\n\nFinally, I found that if you think you have understood a tricky concept after lecture, you usually actually haven’t yet. The metric I found to be most useful for whether I understood something was when I could code it myself. Obviously re-coding all his examples would be crazy time consuming, but try coding specific functions or tricky areas yourself after drawing it and working out a solution without looking. If you can’t get it, look at his code and then take a break and try again. While I struggled with the midterm coding questions (and other questions as well), I ended up acing the  final after I started doing this.\n\nEdit: tl;dr: draw out solutions before beginning to code, review Ramirez’s 401 lectures if it is Java issues, code tricky concepts from class yourself, and go to office hours!", "I'm a former grad TA for 445 (and many other courses).

The reason to go into one school over the other depends on what you want to focus on. If you are double majoring, it is easier to stay in the school you are double majoring in so a lot of students double major in CS so they go to SCI because I think credit wise you don’t have to get 150 credits (don’t quote me on that). SCI focus more on software design for upper levels while DSAS focuses more on Comp Bio research. Also tuition is better in DSAS.

I feel like the value of my education exceeds it's cost, and I'm happy that I'm a student here.\n\nThe professors are great. They are kind and effective educators who care about your education. There are definitely some to avoid, but you'd hear about those ones quickly as you become part of the Pitt CS community.\n\nRegarding internship opportunities, if you work hard to build a good resume and build your technical interview skills, you can definitely get an internship at any of the big four tech companies. You may have to work harder for it than students at top ranked schools, but that will help you build character and you won't feel entitled.\n\nRegarding community, it's great.

But you will get a great education and a really strong platform to enter industry as a Data Scientist, Data Engineer or ML Scientist. You will also have a huge leg up because exiting with a masters in 5 years is a huge bonus for ML/Data Science internships that require Masters. \n\nBut want to be clear this is if you want to work in industry as a data scientist or ML engineer. If you want to do academia or research at a high level you could do CS. If you mean AI/ML as in robotics and training cars and robots that is CMU not Pitt that I would recommend. \n\nHope that helps."]}

The Math/CS double major at pitt requires 150 credits, while a normal major is only 120, so you won't be able to take things slowly. If you take 18 credits per semester (about six classes), that's only 144 total credits over 4 years, so unless you want to take an extra year, you will want to have credits coming in or take summer classes. I had a number of ap credits coming in, so I had a bit of a \"head start.\" If you have no credits coming in, frankly, I wouldn't recommend it. That said, I think you can test out of some of the early classes, which might help. If you can get out of at least Calc 1 and 2, and CS 401 (the intro programming class), things start to look substantially more doable. You should definitely ask an advisor about this - just email the undergraduate director or an advisor on the website, and they will give you good info.\n\nIn terms of what to expect, both programs are fairly standard. The math major includes some required courses on calculus, diffeq, linear algebra, and real analysis as a basis, and then a selection of upper level math courses in a variety of subjects.

I wasn't initially considering it super seriously, but it is one of top 3 options right now as I was graciously offered admission to the Honors program and given a full ride through the Chancellor's Scholarship. Regarding Pitt's CS program, I can't find much information on it online, as it is not super high ranked or prestigious (just about rank 50 on USNews and CSRankings) and seems to be a newer school. From what I can gather reading articles and some old forum posts, it looks like Pitt is starting to pour a lot of resources into the CS department and school of computing, which could result in it being a better experience for me and down the line (correct me if I am wrong). So, I had some questions for current/former Pitt CS students:\n\n1. How is the overall CS program at Pitt? Would you consider it strong overall?\n2. How are the faculty for CS? I have heard from a couple forum posts that they are decent.\n3. Being that Pitt isn't a super big CS school, does it still get attention from major recruiters? I feel like it would be hard considering CMU is right next door.\n4. Is it possible to get good internships as well at Pitt CS, considering being in Pittsburgh but right next to CMU?\n5. How does Pitt's CS program stack up against other schools like PSU/UMD/NYU (other schools I am considering)?\n\nIf anyone has any insight, it would be greatly appreciated and I hope to be joining the class of 2025 soon at Pitt.

If you want to land a top internship, the school you choose is less important than the work you put into your career and your classes. The proliferation of online coding exams have made it much easier for companies to interview at scale and consider tens of thousands of applicants around the world instead of relying on university career centers. This also makes Pitt being next to CMU pretty irrelevant. In fact, CMU being right down the street is pretty great because you can take their classes, research with their professors and institutes, and use their career resources (if you're scrappy enough ;) ).\n\nIn terms of academics, I think it's pretty solid. Pitt CS used to have a huge problem of not having enough professors, but that's no longer an issue.

I know Pitt alums who work at these companies and people who got interviews at google for internships as undergrads but unless something has changed since 2014 they do not attend our career fairs. I will also add most of my contacts were in SSOE so I don’t personally know any CS majors at these companies.\n-\tIf you’re worried about prestige SSOE is more established than SCI. If you got into UHC and a chancellor’s scholarship you won’t have any problem transferring to SSOE to major in Computer Engineering. CompE has more hardware coverage and options but there are almost no CS jobs that you can’t get with a CompE job. I have friends that majored in electrical engineering but took all their electives in programming that are now upper software devs. This is an option although I’m not sure a necessary one.\n-\tRegardless of CS or CompE you can do the Pitt co-op program (ran out of the SAOE but available to other majors).

You know the rankings and that’s basically all anybody here would have to go off of unless maybe they did undergrad at one and grad at the other.\n-\tAll that being said when it comes to undergrad degrees there are the IVYs/Stanford/MITs/CMUs etc and then there are the large R1s that are those. Idk how NYU stacks up for CS if it would push it to the upper echelon (it certainly does for some things like Arts afaik) but PSU, UMD, and Pitt are all pretty much equivalent from a standout point as far as recruiting goes (speaking as someone who helps with recruiting at a major international company).\n-\tI’ll add that (largely because of CMU) Pittsburgh in general is a huge hub for tech. Google is the only FAANG that has a major office here but UBER, SAP, ANSYS, and many others have offices here.

It's all basic Java and it shouldn't be difficult for you to pick it back up again", "You can get the gist of 401 by teaching yourself on the internet with some intro to Java tutorials. My 445 section actually did a little refresher section for the first week or two. Maybe give yourself a little head start by reading up on object oriented programming. \n\nIt’s not worth taking 401 if you have the credits. I made that mistake my freshman year. I thought I would get some deeper understanding of the materials, but it actually seemed to cover LESS than the AP exam. Save yourself the time.", "I am also a CS minor, I transferred and took 445 right away. Basically if you answer yes to these questions you're good to go for 445. \nAre you comfortable with arrays, inheritance ( ... extends ...), methods, and thinking your way through loops to know what it includes/excludes easily? If you aren't familiar with some stuff there is always tutoring and office hours, tutoring helped me more when I got stuck. Good luck!", "100% skip 401 if you have previous experience. The class changes drastically between professors, but overall, the class is absolutely pointless if you already know how to code relatively well. The assignments take like 2-3 hours today and it is pretty much just busywork. CS401 is an easy A though, so it is up to you if you want a GPA boost to start off college. CS445 is not very hard so it is still good at entry level. 401 and 445 overlaps a lot. I would personally skip 401 because CS1500+ classes are quite difficult and you may want room in your schedule to possibly retake a class."]}

He asked me if that was the only thing keeping me from committing and I said yes (just make sure you tell how important Pitt is to you.) he said he would talk with someone from financial aid and I ended up getting an additional OOS grant which filled that gap deficit.

We all put ourselves out there to try and meet new people and bam, now we’re friends.\n\nIn your case it’s a little harder because you don’t live on campus, but there are still things you can try. Instead of going home to study maybe try asking a classmate if they want to study together. It sounds like you already know that clubs are a good way to meet people, too. My best advice is to put yourself into spaces that are a little uncomfortable for you. Try something new and you’ll probably end up meeting similar people who are also there doing something they’ve never done before.\n\nI also don’t really enjoy trying to meet new people in bars. It’s a bit of a strange and inebriated experience. Ultimately, meeting one new person will allow to meet many people.

This has proven to have royally screwed me over.\n\nI went to Pitt for undergrad, and when I got accepted into my graduate program I also was approved for the $5000 alumni Pitt2Pitt scholarship, the main reason I continued with Pitt for my graduate schooling. In the 3 years I have been in this program, I was not given this $5000 scholarship until this semester, my last one. Because it's released to you in 2 halves over 2 semesters, I was only given $2500 to cover tuition this semester. I begrudgingly accepted it in the financial aid portal, and applied my federal loan to the remaining balance ($600).\n\nHowever, that apparently wasn't allowed to happen either. In September, I was informed that the alumni scholarship cannot be used for students taking less than 4.5 credits a semester. My balance got placed back to $2500. After hearing about my issue, my school (SCI) graciously granted me an emergency $2000 endowed scholarship to help me with costs. I called the financial aid office, and the staff there allowed me to adjust my federal loan to cover this new remaining balance.\n\n....Well, I just got an email THIS WEEK from the financial aid office saying that my federal unsubsidized loan cannot be applied because I'm only taking 3 credits. This is after multiple staff at the financial aid office all reassured me I could cover my remaining balance with my federal loan, no problem.\n\nThey pushed my balance back to $1700. If I don't pay it off, I don't graduate.\n\nI'm honestly at a loss of what to do or what I can say when I call financial aid tomorrow.

I've looked at the sample plan of study that SCI provides, but I'd also like some student perspective. I have ENGCMP 0200 covered by AP scores (and will hopefully have MATH 0220&amp;0230 and CMPINF 0401 as well). Any experiential tips on scheduling within SCI would be greatly appreciated!", "answers": ["SCI senior here! I definitely agree with the other commenter, the first semester or two are overwhelming before you get a grasp of what the major expects of you. It’s nice you have some AP credits, that will give you a little wiggle room early on. \n\nBefore I go on, [here](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/student-resources/academic-advising-center/general-education-requirements) are the categories I’m referring to. These are a few recommendations of stuff you could knock out freshman year:\n\nIn the Expression category, Public Speaking is a really fun option (and incredibly useful for our major, I honestly believe it should be explicitly required. So many CS folks lack interpersonal skills that help with your career later down the line). Especially in your first semester, it might get you to meet people/open up your comfort zone a little. \n\nDefinitely knock out Stats early to clear out the rest of your Quantitative requirements. Compared to the rest of the math program at Pitt it is really easy, very doable freshman year. \n\nFor the Polymathic category, I recommend the astronomy classes offered at Pitt! They are really fun and again, not too difficult as long as you study. As for the sequential sciences, it depends on what kind of student you are. More math-minded people should go for Physics, I did the two intro neuroscience courses. Very interesting, and no math involved lol. \n\nFor other recommendations, I’ll get more specific. To fill out your history requirements, any courses with Scott Smith are some of the most fun I have had at Pitt, he is an incredible lecturer. For diversity/global requirements, anything German with Uwe Stender is great. If you’re interested in political science at all, Michael MacKenzie is amazing, his political theory class was one of the most interesting classes I’ve taken. \n\nIf you have any questions, let me know!", "Welcome to SCI 😎 \n\nScheduling can kinda be overwhelming for freshmen. You can start searching for classes by Gen-Ed requirement on Peoplesoft. There are a bunch of recommendations for Gen-Eds and professors on this subreddit. \n\nI know you said you're not settled on a major, but if there is a major within SCI that you are leaning towards, you can always take the first/next class in the major(For CS major, I would have recommended taking CS 7 or CMPINF 401, but since your credit will most likely cover that, I would probably recommend taking CS 441 *if* you wanted to go the route of seeing if you like the major!). Also, I think all, if not most, of the degrees in SCI require a stats course, so maybe taking one of those could help you \"stay on track\" while not taking any specific major course yet.", "(Long post warning)\n\nWelcome to Pitt! Firstly, here is some general advice:\n\nI agree with the other commenters in that scheduling for your first semester is tough, especially if you're not settled on a major. However, you'll have plenty of options for each gen ed req. Obviously you should do some research on which classes satisfy which reqs and choose classes that pique your interest.\n\nWhen you're choosing classes, make sure to take advantage of the schedule builder on PeopleSoft. It'll help you avoid scheduling conflicts and inconvenient schedules (having two classes that are located on opposite end of campus back-to-back would not be a good time).\n\nUnfortunately, you're gonna mostly be on your own in terms of scheduling for your first semester. Your advisor won't be able to provide much actual scheduling advice. The SCI advisors mainly help you fulfill reqs and keep you on track; they can't tell you things like which classes are good or which professors are good for a given class.\n\nIn the meantime, you should search/ask around this sub for classes you could take. Make sure to research your professors (RateMyProfessors is biased but it's better than going in blind).\n\nAfter your first semester, though, it's a good idea to ask around for scheduling advice. Upperclassmen have personal experience and can give you better advice than your advisor. Plenty of people on this sub would be willing to share their experiences in a class or with a professor if you asked, myself included.\n\nOnto the reqs themselves:\n\nYour AP credit will definitely come in handy here. ENGCMP 200, MATH 220/230, and CMPINF 401 are all *very* common freshman classes, so skipping them will give you a bit of a head start.\n\nFor the quantitative req, since you'll have Calc 1 and 2 out of the way, consider taking stats like others have said. Afaik the most common stats classes that people take for the req are STAT 200 and 1000 (STAT 1000 is the class you get credit for if you pass the AP Stats test).\n\nAs for the other reqs, I don't really have many specific recommendations since I haven't taken many gen eds myself. Btw make sure you understand how the scientific req and the global/social/humanistic req work, as they're not as straightforward as the other reqs.\n\nNote that a class can't be used to satisfy two gen ed reqs at the same time, *with the diversity req being the exception*. Thus, you can kill two birds with one stone by taking a class that satisfies the diversity req as well as another gen ed req.\n\nThere are also two courses that all SCI students are required to take: CMPINF 0001 (First-Year Seminar) and CMPINF 0010 (Big Ideas in Computing and Information). FYS is a small 1-credit class taught by the SCI advisors where you learn about basic intro-to-college stuff like gen ed reqs, campus resources, and what a lecture is (no joke). Big Ideas is a 4-credit class where you learn about broad concepts in CS and IS (and some basic skills like git and Python). Definitely take these two in your first year, if not your first semester.\n\nFurthermore, since you're coming in undecided, you could try taking the next course in the sequence for a major to get a feel for what the major is like. For example, if you're leaning toward CS, you could try taking CS 441 or 445 to see if CS is a fit for you.\n\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to lmk.\n\ntl;dr: do your research, ask around, take stats/first-year seminar/big ideas, take classes that you're interested in"]}

In particular, I’m looking for info about the second class, Digital Studio: Creative Coding. If anyone has done the Academic Community and has advice on what it’s like, I would love to hear it!", "answers": ["I took it fall 2020 which is the first time it was offered, I don’t know if classes online made the experience better or worse but joining this community was probably my best decision in scheduling classes. There was about 10 people in the community and they were all absolutely amazing! Having 3 classes with the same people makes it a lot more comfortable and easier to make friends because you are seeing them so much.  The digital media and academic foundations classes were merged with other students, but the creative coding was only the bytes and pixels.\n\nIf you have Jeremy Boyle as your professor for the coding class you will have a great time. I don’t even like coding too much yet that was my favorite class. He is extremely nice and helpful and will accommodate anything. He even sent us cookies once! You could tell he truly cared about our academic success as well as our mental health. \n\nThe class itself was really interesting. You learn to code C++ in arduino. We started out learning how to make a light blink and ended up making a whole scene with music, lights, and motors. We had weekly assignments to code but they were all small and built on what we learned in class. After the first couple weeks you get more and more creative freedom with how you decide to do the assignments. We also had readings about history of computers and coding used to make art/music. If you like art that’s a bonus. This class is taught as if you have no knowledge of coding so if you already know how to code you will be bored. \n\nThe only downside in my opinion is that the academic foundations class (which is mandatory for all freshman) was merged with the “how to make a movie” community and it was almost completely focused on internships and opportunities for film students. There really was not a lot of talk on other internships, etc. but it wasn’t too big of a deal. If you have this class in person I think you guys get to travel around Pittsburgh together so idk maybe things will be different. The new media class had weekly readings that were sometimes long and then in class discussions where participation is graded. I learned a lot from this class that I didn’t already know even though sometimes the readings confused me lol. \n\nSo yeah I would highly recommend it! It does depend on the other students you are with so maybe I just got lucky with having 10 really nice people but it’s a great way to find people with common interests that you can spend a lot of time with. I’m sure it will be even better getting to see these people in person."]}

The way he had the course set up was you had 2 midterms exam one that was on like informatics stuff and the other was on topics of more structural biology and you had one final project and and optional final you that would replace your lowest midterm exam", "Hey! I will be teaching the course this semester and for most Fall and Spring semesters for the foreseeable future. I will cover all of this in the first lecture, but I wanted to put it here for any lurkers or those considering taking the course in the future.\n\n**tl;dr:** There will be no programming this semester. We will use pseudocode to convey how you would solve a problem computationally. I have reorganized the material into the core methods we use to approach problems like a computationalist: (1) Search and Similarity, (2) Pattern Recognition, (3) Statistical Inference, and (4) Optimization and Simulation. If you are interested in learning \"how to think like a computationalist\", I encourage you to give the course a chance at least through the third lecture. I would caution against taking this course as a buffer elective as it is a very different way of thinking than biology/chemistry focuses on. (Many of my top performers are not computational biology majors, but they have always expressed interest in the topic and put in the work.)\n\nAs mentioned in the other response, I have been trying to find a balance of programming in the course for people like yourself, who are taking the course as an elective, and those who are taking it as a core course in their computational biology major. In general, computational biology majors tend to favor including Python in the course, as they feel it directly prepares them for their potential career. People taking the course as an elective tend to suggest removing Python from the course, as computational biology is already a complicated subject. You can see my [Spring 2024](https://aalexmmaldonado.com/teaching/courses/pitt-biosc1540/2024s/#teaching-evaluations), [Fall 2024](https://aalexmmaldonado.com/teaching/courses/pitt-biosc1540/2024f/#teaching-evaluations), and [Spring 2025](https://aalexmmaldonado.com/teaching/courses/pitt-biosc1540/2025s/#teaching-evaluations) OMETs to see what I'm talking about.\n\nI have been thinking about this all summer. It's an impossible problem to solve since we have two very different student populations in the course. However, I argue that the perceived value of Python in this course is not about learning the syntax, the quirks of Jupyter notebooks, or the subtle differences between lists and tuples; it is about learning how to think algorithmically. This \"algorithmic thinking\" is not tied to a single programming language. Once you learn one programming language well, it is much easier to pick up others. (P.S. If I had to learn programming over again, I would first learn Zig, Mojo, then Python/TypeScript/Go/Gleam. Zig is a more friendly C; I'm betting that Mojo will become the de facto scientific computing language; and Python/TypeScript/Go/Gleam will help you with gluing these together into useable applications. Rust has been gaining adoption, but the culture is meh.)\n\nPedagogically, the biggest challenge I face in this course is the widespread use of LLMs to complete homework assignments and projects. I used to have a significant portion of the final grade be these programming assignments and projects. Students who completed them without relying on LLMs, struggled. Some were able to use LLMs to solve the homework with ease, but then performed poorly on the exams. I can make homework assignments \"LLM proof\" by teaching a more modern language like Mojo, but that's only a band-aid. I can make the homework assignments too challenging for LLMs, but that also punishes the students, as this is supposed to be an introductory course.\n\nMy response is to follow the current trend in higher education and move more towards in-person exams as the way to assess a student's understanding. Thus, the homework assignments should help prepare students for these exams. Since programming requires a range of additional computer literacy beyond the \"algorithmic thinking\", I have decided to teach these concepts using pseudocode. This means you will not be writing or running code on a computer, but using some basic structured language to express how you would solve a problem using a computer.\n\nRegarding the other content, I have reorganized the material to be more organized by technique instead of application. In previous semesters, I discussed Genomics, Transcriptomics, Computational Structural Biology, and Computer-Aided Drug Design. This involved a lot of back and forth between concepts to stay within the same application area. Instead, I have changed the modules to be based on the method/technique. This means we have four modules of \"Search and Similarity\", \"Pattern Recognition\", \"Statistical Inference\", and \"Optimization and Simulation\". I expect this to be easier to digest, allowing you to build your \"how to think like a computationalist\" mindset.\n\nStill, some students will still want to learn more Python. I will have challenge problems for them in order to win Advanced Training Points (ATP) that can earn class-wide rewards. Last Fall I challenged my students to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and that was incredibly fun; I may do that again if there is enough interest.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions here or in person. See you Tuesday!"]}

This lets me pursue other areas of study that I'm interested in. The skills you learn here could be applied to many different fields later on like in education, medicine, law; because you're learning about data analysis and modeling, government stuff, and more, which can be used anywhere. So being able to combine both humanities and STEM in a more and more technologically based world is a good skill to have. I'd encourage you to pursue the major, though not many people are doing it. That can be bad because then you don't have as many people to relate to and there's no dedicated club for CSS like there is for CS and IS, but that also means you're in a niche major and you're unique in the job market, at least in my opinion."]}

They told me students who’ve attended another university must apply as transfer students, even if they’re not bringing credits. So, they canceled my first-year admission. This has been devastating — I left everything behind for this opportunity, and it slipped away over something I didn’t fully understand.\n\nNow, they’ve encouraged me to reapply as a transfer student to the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, since the School of Computing and Information’s deadline already passed.

To be honest, I think that it’s different for everyone. I think I got lucky with a pretty short time to wait for my decision. For example, my friend also applied to Pitt (Dietrich) a week after me, and just heard back last week. Keep a look out in your email from Pitt that says your application is moving into the review phase. Once you get that email, it takes a little longer for them to get the decision out to you.\n\nI would advise to keep checking the portal, but other than that, there’s not much else to do.", "[deleted]"]}

{"question": "Pitt 2022 budget from PG", "context": "Dear Pitt Community Members:\n\nEarlier today, members of our Board of Trustees—acting through the Board’s Executive Committee—convened and approved the University of Pittsburgh’s operating and capital budgets for Fiscal Year 2022.  \n\n\nIt is important to recognize that these budgets follow an exceptionally disruptive year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our strategies, enacted over the last budget cycle to mitigate the financial repercussions of these disruptions, have included:\n\n* Holding tuition and room and board flat.\n* Freezing faculty and staff salaries.\n* Offering a voluntary early retirement option to faculty and staff.\n* Curtailing all nonessential hiring and travel.\n* Pausing most construction projects.\n* Enacting one-time unit-level budget cuts of 5%, which generated an extra $44 million in savings to cover COVID-19 costs related to testing, PPE acquisition, safely populating and depopulating campus, and more.  \n* Receiving significant federal COVID-19 relief, with more than half distributed as direct grants to students.\n\nDespite these historic disruptions, Pitt’s operating and capital budgets for Fiscal Year 2022 represent our institution’s first steps toward a new, post-pandemic normal and a return to in-person instruction this fall. The approved budgets balance our efforts to move on from last year’s budget disruption and begin to engage in a fuller recovery.  \n\n\nSome key highlights:\n\n* Our operating budget is set at $2.6 billion, up 7.2% from last year’s operating budget of $2.4 billion.  \n \n* Our capital budget is set at $351 million, 150% larger than last year’s COVID-19-reduced total of $140 million.  \n \n* Our projected research base is $908 million, in line with last year’s research base. This is the first time in Pitt’s history that our projected research base budget exceeds $900 million.  \n \n* Our operating budget includes a modest pay pool to increase the salaries of eligible faculty and staff. A forthcoming email, sent to employees from Chief Financial Officer Hari Sastry and Senior Vice Chancellor for Business and Operations Dave DeJong, will include further information on these increases.  \n \n* Tuition will increase for the 2021-2022 academic year. On our Pittsburgh campus, tuition will increase by 2.5% for in-state undergraduate and all graduate students and 4.5% for out-of-state undergraduates. Two exceptions:  \n\n   * All in-state and out-of-state undergraduate engineering students will be kept at the base rates rise of 2.5%.  \n\n   * All undergraduates in the School of Computing and Information will see rates rise by an additional 2%, resulting in increases of 4.5% for in-state and 6.5% for out-of-state students.  \n\n\nOn our regional campuses, tuition will increase by 1.5% for both in-state and out-of-state students. As in recent years, we devote much of this increase to funding financial aid for students.   \n \n\n* Room and board costs will increase. Dining costs will rise across all campuses by approximately 3%. On-campus housing costs will increase by approximately 5% on our Pittsburgh campus and between 2% to 4% on our regional campuses.  \n \n* To balance our operating budget, we have adopted a permanent 1% budget reduction, effective across the University.\n\nBoth budgets—as always—are the product of many difficult decisions and tough conversations. I am extremely grateful for our leaders in Harrisburg, who once again voted to support Pennsylvania’s students, families and future by passing our annual appropriation bill. I also want to thank the University Planning and Budgeting Committee for tackling the many difficult decisions associated with these budgets, and I remain incredibly proud of Pitt students, faculty and staff for not just persevering but prospering during these challenging times.   \n\n\nI am excited for the new academic year, the new opportunities it will bring and the chance to see students, faculty and staff continue advancing our university’s mission—creating and leveraging knowledge for society’s gain—together.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nPatrick Gallagher", "answers": ["“Both budgets-as always- are the product of many difficult decisions and tough conversations.” Yeah I’m sure increasing the cost of everything was super hard for you, Patrick🥺", "Staff getting fucked while this asshole gets a 5+% raise inbound.\n\nEdit: Yep insultingly small what a shocker.\n\nDouble edit: The budget book says they could probably afford double this without going into the negatives in the budget. While the university lost money last year (168m USD), their total assets are a little less than the beginning of FY 2019-2020 as they made (totally not profited, this is a non profit zone) 111 million USD that year. Even with 5% inflation this year we can only get 1.5%?? The university can and should do better than this.", "[deleted]", "im not even on a dining plan this year but is anything even changing that much? why are they upping the price?", "Good to see them saying fuck the cs students and helping out the engineering students instead"]}
